[Quest_1]
Name=Finding a Lifeline in a Strange Place
Occur_String1=Hello! Feeling better?
Occur_String2=Where am I?
Occur_String3=You must not remember.<br>You're in Dudrin City, the capital of the Dudrin dominion.
Occur_String4=I found you lying unconscious in a forest, so I've moved you here.<br>You look like a knight. May I ask your name?
Occur_String5=I can't remember who I am or where I'm from.
Occur_String6=Maybe you were traumatized by whatever happened to you.<br>Don't worry. I'm sure your memories will come back eventually.
Occur_String7=The Mayor asked me to send you to her as soon as you wake up.<br>She's the governor here in Dudrin and a very wise person.
Occur_String8=She may be able to help you.<br>Let me take you to her.
Doing_String=Dudrin is a dominion of the Lorencia Kingdom, but it's governed by the mayor of Dudrin City. Ms. Andrea is also the spiritual leader of the community.
Completable_String1=You woke up. You don't look like you're hurt.
Complete_String=I woke up in a strange place called Dudrin City. I had no memory of how I got here or even who I was. A young woman named Linda said she found me unconscious in a forest, and she took me here. I didn't know what else to do, so I decided to meet the mayor of the city as she suggested.
List_String=Andrea, the mayor of Dudrin City, was waiting for me to wake up. Let's go talk to her.
Mission_String=Follow Linda's instructions
Mission_Target1=Meet the Dudrin City Mayor
Mission_Target2=Talk to Andrea
Mission_Target3=Meet the Local Police Administrator
Mission_Target4=Talk to Ilina
Mission_Target5=Move to the entrance of the Amberial Forest

[Quest_2]
Name=A New Beginning
Occur_String1=Dudrin has enjoyed prosperity for generations,<br>exporting ores to Lorencia or other states.
Occur_String2=And now it's facing one of its biggest challenges.
Occur_String3=I'm sorry, but that's not my problem. Could you just tell me how I got here? I'll get out of your hair as soon as you tell me.
Occur_String4=Dudrin City is the only safe place in all of Dudrin.<br>Everywhere else, wild animals are attacking us Humans and Dwarves alike.
Occur_String5=The local police are doing their best to keep them at bay, but they can't keep it up forever.<br>In other words, you're stuck here,
Occur_String6=and the city is built around a mine on barren land.<br>I expect everyone in my city to pull their weight, especially in a state of emergency like this, and you're no exception.
Occur_String7=You look like a knight. Go talk to Ilina at the police administration department.<br>She's in charge of recruiting knights to kill mutant animals.
Occur_String8=Go prove to her that you're worth your keep.
Doing_String=The Lorencia Royal Army, instead of helping us, is just wandering about the Amberial Forest for a reason only it knows.
Completable_String1=Are you here to apply for the contractual knight position?<br>You'll be paid based on the level of your mission.<br>Let me warn you - this job can cost your life.
Complete_String=The mayor said I must earn my keep if I want to stay in Dudrin city, and that I must hire myself out to the local police on a contract basis. Having no memory and no place to go, I went to see Local Police Administrator Ilina, like the mayor asked.
List_String=Go to Police Administrator Ilina and make an employment contract.
Mission_String=Apply to become a Contract Knight
Mission_Target1=Talk to Ilina

[Quest_3]
Name=First Contract Mission
Occur_String1=You're the knight Linda found in the Amberial Forest, aren't you?<br>That forest is teeming with mutant animals. She risked her life to get you out of there.
Occur_String2=You should be grateful to her.
Occur_String3=There are two types of strangers in Dudrin City:<br>Civilians working at the newk mine and knights-errant working for the local police.
Occur_String4=You're a knight, so I assume you want to work for us police, yes?
Occur_String5=What else can I do? Do I even have a choice?
Occur_String6=Alright. As of this moment, you're a contract knight signed up with the Dudrin Police.<br>Recently, wild animals in the Amberial Forest have been acting violently for some reason.
Occur_String7=That includes the Dark Spiders,<br>mutant forest spiders that keep sneaking into Dudrin City.<br>Your first mission is to exterminate 3 Dark Spiders.
Occur_String8=Through this mission, we will assess your ability and set standards for our future contracts.<br>Kill some spiders, then go to the Local Police Western Post to the west of the Amberial Forest.
Occur_String9=Police Chief Cain there will evaluate your work.
Doing_String=He is at the Western Post, fighting mutant animals.
Completable_String1=(Here's another costly and potentially worthless contract knight. This one had better be good.)
Complete_String=I received my first mission as a contract knight from Police Administrator Ilina. It was to exterminate Dark Spiders that threaten the peace of Dudrin City. I was able to take care of it quickly and report to Police Chief Cain. I'm surprised by my own strength. Who am I?
List_String=I received my first mission as a contract knight from Police Administrator Ilina. I have to take care of it and report to Police Chief Cain.
Mission_String=Carry out your first mission as a contract knight in the Amberial Forest and report to Police Chief Cain
Mission_Target1=Arrive at the Amberial Forest
Mission_Target2=Kill Dark Spiders

[Quest_11]
Name=Kill Mutated Spiders
Occur_String1=You must be a new contract knight. Report.
Occur_String2=Targets: 3 Dark Webspinners. They're all dead. There are no injuries on my end, either.
Occur_String3=You're impressive! You were able to take care of 3 Dark Spiders, even though you'd never done it before.<br>All right, are you up for a more dangerous mission?<br>The riskier your job, the better your pay.
Occur_String4=Mutated spiders breed like nobody's business.<br>We have to destroy their eggs to make a dent in their population.
Occur_String5=Eliminate Webspinners and destroy their eggs.<br>When you're done, go help Special Force Member Royce. He's hiding on the south side of the forest.
Occur_String6=What do you do while your contract knights take care of such dangerous missions for you?
Occur_String7=The Lorencia Royal Army is supposed to be in charge of the city's defense, but it's dumped the mutant problem onto us police,<br>and we hire people like you to keep ourselves alive.
Occur_String8=This isn't the only place infested by mutants, and we're spread thin as it is.<br>If you understand, then get going.
Doing_String=Royce is the best scout in the Lorencia Kingdom, but his missions are so dangerous, he needs someone like you for help.
Completable_String1=Hmpf, what's a contract knight doing here?
Complete_String=Impressed by my performance on my first mission, Police Chief Cain gave me a new mission: Exterminate mutated spiders and destroy their lairs. After destroying the heinous-looking Webspinners and their lairs, I joined Special Force Member Royce of the local police.
List_String=I've received a new mission from Police Chief Cain.<br>When I'm done with the mission, I have to help Royce scout the south side of the forest.
Mission_String=Kill Webspinners and report to Special Force Member Royce of the local police
Mission_Target1=Kill Webspinners
Mission_Target2=Destroy Spider Eggs

[Quest_12]
Name=Finding the Queen Spider
Occur_String1=I don't trust contract knights. You go your way, I'll go mine.
Occur_String2=...<br>Your boss Cain sent me to help you.
Occur_String3=Captain Cain sent you? Ah, sorry I was rude.<br>These days every Tom, Dick, and Harry wants to be a contract knight
Occur_String4=because of the money, and I just can't trust anyone.<br>But if Captain Cain trusts you, then so can I.
Occur_String5=I'm here to keep an eye on mutants and report their movements to our bases, sending messenger pigeons.
Occur_String6=I've just located a lair of mutated spiders.<br>There's a queen spider, too.
Occur_String7=She's hiding out on the southern part of the forest, surrounded by her guards.<br>Destroying spider eggs won't work so long as she exists.
Occur_String8=Captain Cain sent you to help me. Then exterminate the queen spider for me.<br>I can't leave my post; someone has to keep an eye on those mutants.
Occur_String9=I know what you're thinking.<br>Being a scout is tough.
Occur_String10=You seem pretty good at what you're doing.<br>I'll go get rid of the queen spider.
Doing_String=Being a scout isn't tough because it's risky,<br>but because it's lonely.
Completable_String1=I'm glad to see you get back alive.<br>Those mutated spiders can't threaten Dudrin City anymore, all thanks to you.
Complete_String=I exterminated the queen spider for Special Force Member Royce in the south of the forest, who was risking his life on a recon mission. I have a feeling that he and I will get along.
List_String=Special Force Member Royce has given me a mission:<br>exterminate the queen spider to stop further birth of mutated spiders.
Mission_String=Kill the Queen Spider and report to Local Police Special Force Member Royce
Mission_Target1=Kill the Queen Spider

[Quest_13]
Name=A Questionable Mission
Occur_String1=I know it can't have been easy to fight the queen spider,<br>but I need you to get moving again.
Occur_String2=Get some mutant spider legs and deliver them to Leo, the commander of the Lorencia Royal Army.
Occur_String3=You work for the Dudrin Police.<br>Why are you taking orders from the Lorencia Royal Army?
Occur_String4=Dudrin is a dominion of the Lorencia Kingdom, the most powerful state on the MU Continent.
Occur_String5=It's governed by the mayor as it has political freedom, but it still relies on the Lorencia Army for its defense.
Occur_String6=We police are just here to maintain public peace. <br>We can't refuse orders from the commander of the Lorencia Army from the mainland.
Occur_String7=Dudrin is under attack by mutants, and the army wants spider legs.<br>Is this a joke?
Occur_String8=Unfortunately, it's not. But what can we do? An order is an order.
Occur_String9=Working for the army wouldn't be bad for you, though.<br>If nothing else, it pays better than working for the local police.<br>What's your name?
Occur_String10=%s_9_1... You're Royce, right?<br>Stay alive. I want to see you again.
Doing_String=Commander Leo is at the Lorencia Army Base east of here.<br>He thinks he's better than everyone else, but he's not a bad sort if you get to know him. Be nice, all right?
Completable_String1=You're not from the police.
Complete_String=Royce gave me a mission that I couldn't understand: Get some mutant spider legs and deliver them to Leo, the commander of the Lorencia Royal Army. Gathering spider legs in the middle of a war? Seriously?! I took care of the mission because I like Royce, but that didn't mean I liked doing it.
List_String=I have to exterminate mutated spiders and deliver their severed legs to Leo, the commander of the Lorencia Royal Army.
Mission_String=Collect Spider Legs and deliver them to Lorencia Commander Leo
Mission_Target1=Spider Legs

[Quest_14]
Name=Attending to the Nobility
Occur_String1=I asked the police for spider legs, and they sent me a contract knight instead of one of their own.<br>Those lazy bastards!
Occur_String2=The police are busy fighting mutants.<br>I got rid of a queen spider to help them.
Occur_String3=Ah, so you're the famous knight who singlehandedly got rid of the queen spider.<br>I thought you were one of those drifters.
Occur_String4=How'd you like to work for the Lorencia Royal Army on a contract basis?<br>I welcome good warriors like you anytime.<br>I can also pay you better than the local police.
Occur_String5=I don't care who you are, so long as you can pay me and I can get my memories back.
Occur_String6=You know this place is rich in newk ore, right?<br>A few nobles are here from the mainland to invest in the ore.
Occur_String7=I tried to warn them about the situation in the Amberial Forest, but they were adamant about taking a tour around it.<br>And sure enough, they got bitten by those mutated spiders.
Occur_String8=I needed the spider legs because of them.<br>The mucus produced in the spider legs is the only antidote to their venom.<br>Use the mucus to treat the nobles who are sprawled out on the ground in the forest, will you?
Occur_String9=The local policemen are out there risking their lives to fight mutants, and you're here attending to some nobles who want to go sightseeing. I don't like you.
Doing_String=Do you think I like to fawn over those spoiled noblemen?<br>I'm not so high on the food chain, and I have to do whatever I can to survive.
Completable_String1=Good job.<br>Those stupid nobles... I bet they won't come back to Enova again.
Complete_String=I met with Lorencia Army Commander Leo. He asked me to treat the Lorencian nobles who came here on a business trip and got themselves bitten by mutated spiders. I got it done, but I felt disgusted that Leo was more worried about some spoiled nobles than the peace of Dudrin City.
List_String=I have to find the Lorencian nobles who were bitten by mutated spiders and treat them with Spider Mucus.
Mission_String=Treat the Spider-bitten Nobles and report to Leo
Mission_Target1=Treat the Lorencian Nobles

[Quest_15]
Name=Swaying Faith
Occur_String1=You look like a contract knight.<br>Do you mind me asking you a favor?
Occur_String2=(He's polite for a member of the Lorencia Army.)<br>Go on.
Occur_String3=There's a woman named Rosa to the north of here, where the Shadow Phantom knights of the Elven Kingdom are stationed.<br>She's a priestess of Rugard.  Word has it that she's been unwell lately.
Occur_String4=Could you get some Shama's intestines and bring them to her?<br>They've long been used to cleanse the contaminated body.
Occur_String5=Also, please give this letter to her.<br>This is very important to me.
Doing_String=God is neglecting us, his children,<br>even though we're under attack from Pandemonium<br>and I don't understand why.
Completable_String1=Someone named Jerome asked me to give these to you.<br>He said they can restore your health...
Complete_String=I killed Shamas and Electric Shamas and delivered their innards to Rugard Priestess Rosa, who is staying with the Shadow Phantom knights of the Elven Kingdom.
List_String=I have to kill Shamas and Electric Shamas and deliver their innards to Rugard Priestess Rosa, who is staying with the Shadow Phantom knights.
Mission_String=Obtain Shamas' Intestines and deliver them to Rosa
Mission_Target1=Shama Stomachs
Mission_Target2=Shama Spleens

[Quest_16]
Name=Rosa's Sympathy
Occur_String1=This is very kind of him. He didn't have to do it, though.<br>Thank you, Knight. I'll make a decoction and drink it.
Occur_String2=Oh, he also gave me this letter.
Occur_String3=[A cloud descends over her face as she reads the letter.] ...<br>I'm sorry Jerome, but I don't know the answer to this, either.<br>In fact, I don't think anyone knows what Rugard has in mind for us...
Occur_String4=What is that about?
Occur_String5=Jerome is a pious follower of Rugard's, and his mind has been in a turmoil since Pandemonium's invasion.<br>He doesn't understand why Rugard, the god of protection, wouldn't do anything about the situation.
Occur_String6=He wants to know why a god wouldn't help him? Is he serious?<br>There are a lot of people out there struggling to stay alive every day. I'm not going to get involved in some religious farce. I'm leaving.
Occur_String7=Knight, please don't go.  Jerome needs your help to find peace of mind.<br>Perhaps Priest Benedict by Lake Koha knows the answer.<br>Could you deliver Jerome's letter to him?
Doing_String=Poor Jerome.<br>Maybe he's too kindhearted to be a soldier.<br>It must have been hard on him to watch his friends get killed in the battlefield.
Completable_String1=This is Jerome's letter. Rosa asked me to give it to you.<br>I don't know how or what to explain to you.
Complete_String=I delivered Jerome's letter to Priest Benedict by Lake Koha in the Amberial Forest.
List_String=I have to deliver Jerome's letter to Priest Benedict by Lake Koha in the Amberial Forest.
Mission_String=Deliver Jerome's letter to Priest Benedict by Lake Koha in the Amberial Forest
Mission_Target1=Talk to Benedict

[Quest_18]
Name=Game of Gods
Occur_String1=You don't have to explain anything. Jerome is losing his faith,<br>and Rosa doesn't know what to do about it, so she's asking me for help.
Occur_String2=If Rugard really is your god, why isn't he doing anything about this war?
Occur_String3=The Continent of Mu is ruled by two opposing forces.<br>First, the Heraus Coalition. It worships Rugard, the god of protection,
Occur_String4=and consists of us Humans, Elves, and the Dwarves.<br>The force opposing us is the Line Alliance, consisting of the children of War God Bulcan.
Occur_String5=According to the Bible, Rugard and Bulcan agreed with each other not to intervene in earthly matters. This was to promote fair competition between their children.
Occur_String6=So they're playing with us.<br>They pit us against each other, and whoever wins, wins. It's a sick joke...
Occur_String7=...<br>We're on our own for now,<br>but if we pray hard enough, Rugard will listen to us.<br>He won't forsake us forever.
Occur_String8=We'll see.
Occur_String9=Could you bring this holy water to Rosa?<br>It helps relieve fatigue,<br>and it's the only thing I can offer to her at this moment.
Doing_String=You're a stranger, but also a Human. <br>Rugard loves us Humans.<br>May He bless you on your journey.
Completable_String1=This is holy water from the Rugard Temple. Didn't he say anything?
Completable_String2=No. Drink the holy water and get well.<br>I don't believe in your god, but I know he's important to you.<br>I hope you'll find the answer to your question.
Complete_String=I delivered the holy water from the Rugard Temple to Rugard Priestess Rosa at the south of Lake Koha.
List_String=I have to deliver the holy water from the Rugard Temple to Rugard Priestess Rosa at the south of Lake Koha.
Mission_String=Deliver the holy water to the Rugard Priestess at the south of Lake Koha in the Amberial Forest
Mission_Target1=Talk to Rosa

[Quest_19]
Name=Mutation of Giant Trees
Occur_String1=I'm Henry, a lumberjack.<br>I don't like working in the mine, so I make a living cutting down trees instead.<br>Recently, the trees in the forest started walking around and attacking everything!
Occur_String2=(The Evil Energy is now affecting plants as well as animals.)<br><br>I'll take care of them. You should go back home.
Occur_String3=Oh, thanks!<br>By the way, are you the famous contract knight who cut down the queen spider?
Occur_String4=I did that. Why?
Occur_String5=Police Chief Cain is looking for you.<br>He wants you to come to the Western Gorge.
Occur_String6=...<br>(He must have a job for me.)
Doing_String=By the way, that Priestess Rosa is really pretty, isn't she?<br>She's kind, too.<br>Oh, it's not what you think...
Completable_String1=I've been looking for you. There's something I'd like you to do, quickly.
Complete_String=After exterminating the mutated Mandrakes, I went to Police Chief Cain who had been looking for me.
List_String=After exterminating the mutated Mandrakes, I went to Police Chief Cain who had been looking for me.
Mission_String=Kill the Mutated Plants and meet Police Chief Cain
Mission_Target1=Kill the Mandrakes

[Quest_20]
Name=Evil Energy Generators of Pandemonium
Occur_String1=Are you asking me this in an official capacity?
Occur_String2=I am, and your pay will be based on the previous rate. The Evil Energy is running rampant in this place.
Occur_String3=I know. It's a passageway between Pandemonium and this realm.<br>I've been told Pandemonium has invaded for the first time in two hundred years.
Occur_String4=The Demons from Pandemonium are setting up Evil Energy generators everywhere in the forest <br>to stimulate the generation of the energy.
Occur_String5=Please destroy as many Evil Energy generators as you can, <br>before the Amberial Forest is swamped in Evil Energy.
Doing_String=I felt like we've started off on the wrong foot. Can we start over?<br>The more I see you around, the more you grow on me.<br>Since I'm older than you, you can think of me as kind of like your big brother.
Completable_String1=I've destroyed all the Evil Energy generators I can find,<br>but quite a lot of Evil Energy has already been generated.
Complete_String=I've destroyed Evil Energy generators that were pumping out Evil Energy.
List_String=Destroy the Evil Energy generators pumping out Evil Energy.
Mission_String=Destroy the Evil Energy Generators and report to Police Chief Cain
Mission_Target1=Destroy the Evil Energy Generators

[Quest_21]
Name=Finding Royce
Occur_String1=Welcome back, Knight.  It seems like it was only yesterday<br>that I gave you your first mission—Dark Spiders, right?—<br>and you're already famous throughout Dudrin.
Occur_String2=I thought you were the police administrator. Why are you here<br>instead of in Dudrin City?
Occur_String3=The police are spread thin, so it's all hands on deck. Now, let me brief you on your new mission.
Occur_String4=Royce left on a recon mission and hasn't returned.<br>The last message he sent informed us that a group of Larva Grenadiers were heading for our mine base, carrying backpacks.
Occur_String5=He should be following them right now.
Occur_String6=Are you saying Royce is missing?<br>Something really bad must have happened for him to lose contact with you.
Occur_String7=I know, and that's why we're worried. Please go find him.
Doing_String=Those Larvas... What do you think they're carrying in their backpacks to the mine base?
Completable_String1=(Could this bag belong to Royce?<br>I'd better open it.)
Complete_String=Local Police Special Force Member Royce has gone missing during a recon mission. Something really bad must have happened for someone as tough as him to lose contact with his forces. He's one of the few good men I've come to know in this strange place. While looking for him, I found his bag dropped near the Larva Encampment.
List_String=Special Force Member Royce has gone missing during a recon mission.<br>I must find him as quickly as possible.
Mission_String=Search for the Missing Special Force Member
Mission_Target1=Royce's Trace

[Quest_22]
Name=Mailman
Occur_String1=[Checking the letter inside the bag]<br>(From Royce,  To Police Administrator Ilina.
Occur_String2=(Royce wrote this letter to Ilina,  but the message is encrypted. I can't understand it.)
Occur_String3=(I should bring it to Ilina. She should be able to read it.  By the way, Royce...  Where are you?)
Doing_String=………….
Completable_String1=I've been waiting. Have you found Royce?
Completable_String2=I found Royce's bag. He wrote a letter to you.
Complete_String=I found Royce's bag near the Larva Camp.  There was a letter addressed to Ilina inside the bag,  but I couldn't read it because it was encrypted.  I delivered the letter to Ilina.  But Royce is still missing.  I hope he's safe.
List_String=I found Royce's bag near the Larva Camp.  There was a letter addressed to Ilina inside the bag,  but I can't read it because it is encrypted.  I have the letter deliver it to Ilina.
Mission_String=Take Royce's Bag to Ilina in the Northern Cabin
Mission_Target1=Talk to Ilina

[Quest_23]
Name=The Larvas' Schemes
Occur_String1=Royce wrote this letter to me?<br>Um... It's written in a code used among us in the Heraus Coalition, in case it falls into the hands of Pandemonium.
Occur_String2=What does it say?
Occur_String3=<br>"Larva Grenadiers have headed out to the mine base, carrying backpacks."
Occur_String4=<br>"A second party consisting of their commanders is getting ready to follow them."
Occur_String5=I'm too deep inside enemy territory.<br>I'm afraid I might not be able to get out of here safely.
Occur_String6=[Reading the letter] "If you can read this letter, then please give it to Police Administrator Ilina in the Northern Cabin."
Occur_String7=That's all.<br>Royce wrote this because he knew my camp is closer to him than the police outpost is.
Occur_String8=Royce is the first really good guy I've met in this place.<br>What can I do to help?
Occur_String9=When he wrote the letter, the second party hadn't left yet.<br>Go to the Larva Camp and check what the enemies are up to.
Doing_String=Those Larvas... What are they up to?
Completable_String1=I've found this on a Larva in the second party. They looked like they were high-ranking officers.

Mission_Target1=Violent Larva Captain's Personal Belongings

[Quest_24]
Name=Finding Bombs
Occur_String1=This is a detonator!<br>This means the advance party carried explosives to the mine base.
Occur_String2=They're going to blast a hole into the mine, so they can force themselves into the mining tunnels!
Occur_String3=What do you mean? Why would they want to force themselves into the tunnels?
Occur_String4=You've been helping the Dudrin Police kill mutant animals, %s_9_1,<br>and that must have done a number on them.
Occur_String5=I think they've decided to give up on the mutant animals and infiltrate Dudrin City themselves,<br>through the mining tunnels.
Occur_String6=The ground near the mine base is the weakest.<br>So they are planning on blasting that spot to get inside the mine!
Occur_String7=If the Pandemonium Army pours into Dudrin through the tunnels, the city will fall in no time.
Occur_String8=But since we have their detonators, we still have time. I'll go to the mine base and stop the bombing.
Doing_String=Warn Mine Base Chief Hans of this first.<br>He may be fussy, but he's good at what he does. He'll be helpful to you.
Completable_String1=I'm with the Dudrin Police. The Larvas are trying to blast holes into the mine...
Complete_String=I found detonators from the second party of Larvas, which they planned to use to blast holes into the mine and invade Dudrin City through the mining tunnels. I went to the mine base and warned its chief, Hans, about this.

Name=Mutated Plants
Occur_String1=This place is infested with mutated plants, just like everywhere else.<br>There are so many. We Shadow Phantoms can't handle them on our own.
Occur_String2=Among them is the Sapi Unus, they use womanly bodies to prey on men and lure them in.
Occur_String3=Could you kill them and destroy their nests?<br>I'll pay you as much as the Dudrin Police does.
Doing_String=We Shadow Phantoms are the personal guards of Princess Lunedill of the Noria Kingdom.<br>We're the best knights on the MU Continent.
Completable_String1=You're as good as people say you are.<br>Here's your payment.
Complete_String=I exterminated Sapi Unus, one of the plants that have been mutated by black magic, and destroyed their nests for the Shadow Phantom.

Occur_String1=You're late. They're already setting up bombs on the south side of the base.<br>Police Officer Billy went off to stop them, but I'm not sure if he's still alive.
Occur_String2=It's over. Everything's over. Once the bombs go off, it'll be the end of Dudrin.
Occur_String3=Calm down. I've got their detonators.<br>Tell me where they're setting up the bombs.
Occur_String4=It's three looths away to the south.<br>The ground is weakest there, so it's the best place to detonate bombs.
Occur_String5=I don't want to impose on your kindness, but could you look for Billy while you're there?<br>He's not of my own kind, but he's like a son to me.
Doing_String=The Larvas are the administrators of the Pandemonium government.<br>They have a reputation for bravado, but they were allowed to lead this invasion like they did in the Three-year War.<br>Want to know how? They've bribed their higher-ups, those pathetic narcissists.
Completable_String1=Are you Billy, from the Dudrin Police?
Complete_String=The Larva advance party set up explosives on the south side of the mine base  to blast a hole into the mine and invade Dudrin City through the mining tunnel.  I killed the minions of Pandemonium that got in my way and defused the bombs.
List_String=I must disarm the bombs that the Larva advance party has set up on the south side of the mine base.
Mission_String=Disarm the Bombs and talk to Billy
Mission_Target1=Disarm the Bombs

[Quest_32]
Name=The Pandemonium Army's Real Target
Occur_String1=I just watched you disarm the bombs.<br>I came to stop the Larvas, but I was too scared.
Occur_String2=The fact you came here counts for something. Go back to the mine base.<br>That old Dwarf geezer is waiting for you.
Occur_String3=Those Pandemonium jerks, why do they want the Karmatan Mine?
Occur_String4=What are you talking about? I thought the tunnels here are connected to Dudrin.
Occur_String5=No, they're connected to the Karmatan Mine.<br>It's Dudrin's biggest newk mine, in the Weiss Basin.
Occur_String6=Why would they want the mine instead of Dudrin City?
Occur_String7=I got it!<br>It's because newk is Dudrin's most important resource.<br>Without the Karmatan Mine, the people of Dudrin will starve!
Occur_String8=Instead of breaking through Dudrin's defense, they're trying to kill us slowly.<br>Soon, the Pandemonium Army will come surging through the tunnels of the Karmatan Mine!
Occur_String9=Please go to the Weiss Basin and warn Dwarf Guard Kilry about this.<br>You'll have to fight your way through mutants to get there.
Doing_String=Kilry is at the Southern Post in the Weiss Basin.<br>It's not far from here. Please hurry.
Completable_String1=You're so famous, even we Dwarves know about you. By the way, what brings you here?
Complete_String=Pandemonium's target wasn't Dudrin City. It was the Weiss Basin. More specifically, it was the newk mines within the Weiss Basin. I told this to Dwarf Guard Kilry at the Southern Post in the Weiss Basin.
List_String=I have to tell Dwarf Guard Kilry at the Southern Post in the Weiss Basin, that the Pandemonium Army's target is not Dudrin City, but the Weiss Basin. I also need to exterminate Violent Boars that are getting in my way.
Mission_String=Exterminate Violent Boars and inform the Dwarf Guard in the Weiss Basin of the Pandemonium Army's intent.
Mission_Target1=Kill the Violent Boars

[Quest_29]
Name=Warn of the Imminent Danger in the Weiss Basin!
Occur_String1=Let's cut to the chase.<br>The Pandemonium Army isn't after Dudrin, but this place, Weiss Basin.<br>Specifically, they're after the mines.
Occur_String2=Not the capital city, but our mines? Why?
Occur_String3=Because it knows that without the newk mines, Dudrin will starve.
Occur_String4=Hmm... This makes sense.<br>The enemy will have to risk losing many soldiers by attacking Dudrin City. It's fortified so strongly.
Occur_String5=I'd better report this to the chief.<br>Hey, how'd you like to work for the Dwarf Guard on a contract basis?<br>I'll pay you as much as the Dudrin Police does.
Occur_String6=No, I'll talk to your chief. This place is growing on me.
Doing_String=You can find the chief in the Dwarf District on the east side of Dudrin City. His house is pretty nice. You can't miss it.
Completable_String1=You're the Strange Slaughterer, aren't you?<br>I keep an ear to the ground.
Complete_String=Kilry said he was just a soldier. He couldn't leave his post unattended, but the leader of his race had to know that the Weiss Basin was the Pandemonium Army's real target. I met the Dwarf Chief on Kilry's behalf and told him about the enemy's schemes.
List_String=Pandemonium is targeting the Weiss Basin, not Dudrin City. I have to tell this to the Dwarf Chief in Dudrin City and get him ready for the invasion.
Mission_String=Inform the Dwarf Chief in Dwarf Chief's House in Dudrin City of the Pandemonium Army's intent.
Mission_Target1=Talk to Herman

[Quest_30]
Name=Reinforcements Request
Occur_String1=And yet, you don't know the Pandemonium Army is heading for the Weiss Basin.<br>You'd better talk to the Dudrin Police and figure out what to do about it. Let the Lorencia Army in on it, too.
Occur_String2=WHAT?!<br>Duprian! Where's Ramotu Duprian?<br>Kilry at the Southern Post must know about this, too!
Occur_String3=Kilry asked me to tell it to you.<br>Stop panicking and focus.<br>You're the leader of your kind.
Occur_String4=What do you want me to do? If Pandemonium takes over the mines, it'll be the end of the Mining Association.<br>What do I do?! I don't want to go broke!
Occur_String5=The peace of Dudrin is at stake, and you're worried about your Mining Association? Are you kidding me?
Occur_String6=You don't know how many shares of the association I've—you're right, I'm sorry.<br>Well, um, then could you ask Commander Leo for reinforcements?
Occur_String7=We need help from the main forces to fend off the enemy.<br>I'd better go pack—no, excuse me,  I'm needed elsewhere.
Doing_String=I need to close my bank accounts and cancel my insurance. When's the last flight to Lorencia?<br>*Gasp* D-did you hear everything I just said?
Completable_String1=Long time, no see, Knight. You look like you've lost weight.
Complete_String=The Dwarf Chief was too busy thinking about leaving the Weiss Basin before the Pandemonium Army attacked. The only hope I had was the Lorencia Army. I met Lorencia Army Commander Leo to ask for help with defending the basin.
List_String=I have to ask Lorencia Army Commander Leo for help with defending the Weiss Basin.
Mission_String=Go to the Lorencia Commander in Dudrin City
Mission_Target1=Talk to Leo

[Quest_35]
Name=Leaving the People
Occur_String1=I already know Pandemonium is targeting the Weiss Basin.<br>We have a better intel network than the Dudrin Police.
Occur_String2=Then tell me what your plan is.
Occur_String3=I'm sorry, but I'm waiting for the airship to the mainland.<br>I've reported the situation here to the mainland several times, only to get brushed off by the nobility.
Occur_String4=They think this is just some minor commotion caused by the Demons on the continent.<br>I'm going back to the mainland, so I can talk to His Majesty in person.
Occur_String5=Then what about this place? It won't last even a day without your army.
Occur_String6=My so-called army consists of a handful of soldiers. This place needs reinforcements from the mainland.
Occur_String7=The best thing I can do for this place is talk to His Majesty.<br>Hold off the enemy for as long as you can until reinforcements arrive.
Occur_String8=The way I see it, you're just trying to run away. You're not a knight - you're a coward!
Occur_String9=How dare you? You don't even know who you really are!<br>If you don't believe me, then get out of my sight!
Doing_String=…….
Completable_String1=I just met the Lorencia Army Commander.
Complete_String=He refused to help defend the Weiss Basin because he was leaving for Lorencia soon. He said he'd talk to his king and send reinforcements, but to me he sounded like he didn't want to fight a losing war. I'm worried Dudrin will quickly descend into chaos once his army leaves.
List_String=Lorencia Army Commander Leo has refused to help defend the Weiss Basin because he's leaving for Lorencia soon. I should talk to the Dwarf Chief and come up with a different plan.
Mission_String=Inform the Dwarf Chief that the Lorencia Army is leaving
Mission_Target1=Talk to Herman

[Quest_31]
Name=Protect the Outpost!
Occur_String1=The Lorencia Army isn't going to help. It's been decided. We're leaving.<br>We're on our own - I mean, you're on your own.
Occur_String2=No!  Everything's over now.<br>Dudrin will disappear into history,<br>and we'll be fed to those Pandemonium monsters.
Occur_String3=Hey, get a hold of yourself! What can I do to help?
Occur_String4=Th-the outpost...<br>When the enemy attacks the Weiss Basin, its first target will be the outpost.
Occur_String5=The arsenal in the outpost holds weapons that the Dudrin Police and the Dwarf Guard use.
Occur_String6=Tell Kilry at the Southern Post to take his forces to the outpost<br>and protect it at all costs.
Doing_String=He's brave, but too stubborn for my liking.<br>I can't make him do anything he doesn't want to do. He really is an arrogant jerk.
Completable_String1=Good to see you again. Did you talk to my chief?<br>What did he say?
Complete_String=The Dwarf Chief expected the outpost to be the first place the Pandemonium Army would attack when it arrives in the Weiss Basin because it houses an arsenal shared between the Dudrin Police and the Dwarf Guard. I went to Dwarf Guard Kilry at the Southern Post and asked to take his forces to the outpost.
List_String=The outpost will be the first to be attacked when the Pandemonium Army invades the Weiss Basin. I have to tell Dwarf Guard Kilry at the Southern Post to take his forces to the outpost.
Mission_String=Meet the Dwarf Guard at the Southern Post in the Weiss Basin
Mission_Target1=Talk to Kilry

[Quest_101]
Name=A Trader in the Battlefield - 1
Occur_String1=Now, I don't care if you're a knight, a trader, or whatever!<br>Just bring me Belbee fur! I'll pay you good money!
Occur_String2=You're encouraging people to skin beasts. Are you insane?<br>Those beasts are also mutants, you know.
Occur_String3=You don't know what you're talking about. Coats made of Belbee fur are selling like hotcakes among the noblewomen of Lorencia.<br>They're raking in the money!
Occur_String4=Life is like gambling! If you're lucky, you'll hunt a Belbee and be rich. If not, the Belbee will have its fill.<br>If you're too scared, then just go on your merry way!
Doing_String=Do you think I'm stupid? Bring me Belbee fur, or there's no money for you.<br>Take up the challenge, like a brave knight.
Completable_String1=Wow, you really brought Belbee fur!<br>Hey, how'd you like to work for me?
Complete_String=A man named Phili asked me for Belbee fur. Belbees are ferocious beasts indigenous to the Weiss Basin, and their fur is popularly used for making expensive clothes. Belbees have mutated like everything else in Enova. I thought Phili was crazy, encouraging people to kill them for their hides, but apparently countless contract knights jumped at the chance and forfeited their lives. I walked into the lair of the deadly beasts, bracing myself for the same fate as my predecessors, but I came out alive, with the beast fur in my hands.
List_String=I need to kill Prairie Belbees and deliver their fur to Trader Phili.
Mission_String=Collect Belbee Fur and deliver it to Trader Phili
Mission_Target1=Prairie Belbee Fur

[Quest_102]
Name=Crossroads
Occur_String1=Things are falling apart. All the authority figures I've talked to are thinking about leaving.<br>Your chief is one of them.
Occur_String2=The outpost will be the first place the Pandemonium Army hits.<br>Your chief wants you to take everyone you have here and protect the outpost.
Occur_String3=I don't doubt it. The outpost holds the arsenal shared between the Dudrin Police and the Dwarf Guard.<br>But we can't move right now.
Occur_String4=Why not?
Occur_String5=The Evil Energy has reached the Weiss Basin, affecting the animals.<br>Mutant Belbees are killing people.
Occur_String6=Those beasts were ferocious before, but now they're totally out of control.<br>If we leave, we'll be leaving the miners at their mercy.
Occur_String7=But if you lose the arsenal, you'll have nothing to fight this war with.<br>Collateral damage is inevitable in war situations. You should just move to the...
Occur_String8=Are you seriously telling me to leave behind the people I'm supposed to protect?<br>I can't do that.
Occur_String9=...You're going to regret this.<br>We don't have time. Let's just get rid of the leader of the Belbees. The rest will scatter naturally.
Doing_String=Belbees are led by 3 females,<br>and they're called Queen Belbees.  Please be careful.
Completable_String1=I've watched you fight those ferocious creatures from the hill.<br>Thank you for protecting the miners.
Complete_String=I told Dwarf Guard Kilry at the Southern Post about the Dwarf Chief's order to take his forces to the outpost. Kilry refused to follow the order, not wanting to leave the miners who worked near his post to the mercy of the ferocious Belbee beasts. He was being irrational, but I couldn't urge him to abandon the people he was supposed to protect. I exterminated the leaders of Belbees for them, even though I knew we'd have to pay dearly for wasting valuable time.
List_String=I have to kill the 3 Queen Belbees so the rest of them will scatter, so as to protect the people in the Weiss Basin.
Mission_String=Kill the Queen Belbees and report to Kilry
Mission_Target1=Kill the Queen Prairie Belbees

[Quest_103]
Name=The Price for His Decision
Occur_String1=Don't flatter me. By the way, why the long face?
Occur_String2=I've just received a message from the outpost.<br>The Pandemonium Army set the arsenal on fire.
Occur_String3=This wouldn't have happened if I decided to get there quickly.<br>You were right. I let my emotions get the best of me.
Occur_String4=I told you you'd regret it.<br>But what's past is past, and what you did wasn't wrong.<br>Is there anything I can do to help?
Occur_String5=Go five looths to the east, and you'll see wells surrounding a ruined village.<br>Could you draw water from them and use it to put out the fire at the arsenal?
Occur_String6=We can't let the fire spread to the other buildings and burn down the whole outpost.<br>I'll take my soldiers and follow you soon.
Doing_String=Everyone, gather around! We're moving to the outpost.<br>Squad 1! Squad 2! Move! Move!
Completable_String1=I'm with the Dudrin Police. I've brought water<br>on behalf of Dwarf Guard Kilry at the Southern Post.
Complete_String=Sure enough, Kilry and I paid the price for wasting time at the Southern Post: The Pandemonium Army attacked the outpost and set the arsenal there on fire while I was busy fighting the Queen Belbees. But I didn't regret our decision. We may have lost the upper hand in the war, but we protected the miners. Hoping it wasn't too late, I ran to the wells near the mine to get water and help put out fire at the outpost.
List_String=The Pandemonium Army has set the outpost's arsenal on fire.<br>I must go to the wells near the mine, draw water, and bring it to the outpost.
Mission_String=Draw Water from the Wells and deliver it to Duprian
Mission_Target1=West Ruins Well
Mission_Target2=East Ruins Well

[Quest_104]
Name=Extinguish the Fire at the Outpost
Occur_String1=Kilry sent you? Wait, are you the famous contract knight?
Occur_String2=I don't know if I'm famous.<br>I don't even know who I am.<br>Did the Pandemonium Army leave after setting this place on fire?
Occur_String3=We fought tooth and nail.<br>There were twice as many of them as us, but we held our ground.
Occur_String4=Don't get me wrong, but maybe you didn't protect the outpost. Maybe the enemy just wanted to mess with your arsenal.
Occur_String5=Even if it did, we've lost too much.<br>Half the soldiers at the outpost are dead.
Occur_String6=Sorry, where are my manners?<br>I'm Ramotu Duprian, the Dwarf Guard Commander.
Occur_String7=Never mind. Shouldn't we put out the fire first?
Occur_String8=You're right. Please use the water you brought to put out the fire<br>before it spreads to the other buildings.
Doing_String=This may not be the most appropriate time to say this, but did you know that people have a name for you?<br>They're calling you the Strange Slaughterer because of the ruthless way you fight.
Completable_String1=The fire is contained.<br>Was it the Larvas that attacked your outpost?
Complete_String=After drawing water from the well, I came to the outpost  and used the water to contain the fire.  Duprian, the Dwarf Guard Commander in charge of the outpost, said the Pandemonium Army left after setting the outpost's arsenal on fire,  which means the enemy specifically targeted the arsenal in the first place.  Their plan worked, because now the Dudrin Police and the Dwarf Guard don't have enough weapons to fight.
List_String=Use the well water to extinguish the fire at the outpost's arsenal and talk to Dwarf Guard Commander Duprian.
Mission_String=Extinguish the Fire at the Arsenal and talk to Duprian
Mission_Target1=Extinguish the Fire at the Arsenal

[Quest_105]
Name=The Keru Legion's Goal
Occur_String1=Do you mean the Larvas in the Amberial Forest?<br>No. It was the Keru Legion that attacked us.
Occur_String2=Where do you think they're headed?
Occur_String3=Probably to the center of the basin. Every road in the Weiss Basin runs through the center.<br>They're trying to isolate us from the rest of Dudrin.
Occur_String4=But I thought the Pandemonium Army wanted the mines...
Occur_String5=While the Kerus block the roads, the rest of the army will hit the mines. I can picture it in my head.
Occur_String6=Since the Karmatan Mine is the biggest, it has to be the enemy's first target.<br>I'll take the remaining soldiers to the Karmatan Mine.
Occur_String7=You go to the Central Post.<br>Join our forces there and help them fend off the Keru Legion<br>before they set up a camp.
Occur_String8=Oh right, you're a contract knight.<br>We should make a contract. Your pay?
Occur_String9=Forget it. The people of this place are growing on me.<br>Most of them are pretty weird, but they're not too bad.
Doing_String=The Central Post is on a ridge 4 looths away to the east.<br>It's the perfect place to attack the Kerus from.
Completable_String1=Are you the commander of this post? Commander Duprian sent me.<br>I'm to help you fend off the Keru Legion.
Complete_String=Duprian thought the Kerus that burned down the arsenal would set up a camp in the center of the Weiss Basin. That way, they could block all the roads and keep reinforcements from Dudrin City at bay, while the main forces of Pandemonium attack the mines in the basin. I headed out to the Central Post to ambush the Kerus.
List_String=Join Dwarf Guard Khalif and other forces at the Central Post to ambush the Keru Legion.
Mission_String=Suggest that the Dwarf Guard should ambush the Keru Legion
Mission_Target1=Talk to Khalif

Name=Plant Mutation in the Weiss Basin
Occur_String1=I'm honored to meet you, Knight. Have you seen the mutated plants in the Amberial Forest?<br>The same thing is happening here in the Weiss Basin.
Occur_String2=(It's because of the Evil Energy...)
Occur_String3=Recently giant old trees around the outpost have started walking around and thrashing at everything in their path.  We call them Ents.
Occur_String4=I don't care what they're called. They're going to die, and dead things don't need names.
Doing_String=My little sister is a big fan of yours.<br>She'll be overjoyed once she finds out I've met you in person.
Completable_String1=I chopped down those trees you call Ents.<br>They'll make good firewood.
Complete_String=The Evil Energy has reached the Weiss Basin, turning the plants there into a horde of monsters, just like it did in the Amberial Forest. I chopped down a few Ents, the monstrous walking trees that roamed about the outpost, but unless the Evil Energy itself is destroyed, the plants of Enova will continue to mutate.
List_String=Plants in the Weiss Basin are mutating, just like everywhere else.<br>I'd better exterminate the walking trees, Ents, around the outpost and protect the local miners.
Mission_String=Kill the Ents and report to Duprian's Guard
Mission_Target1=Kill the Ents

[Quest_108]
Name=Finding Linda - 1
Occur_String1=I've just received a message that Linda has gone missing while she was in the Weiss Basin.
Occur_String2=She's the woman who found me in the forest and took me to Dudrin City.<br>What was she doing in that dangerous place?
Occur_String3=She had something to give you.<br>It must have been important.
Occur_String4=Did she have something to give me? Any idea where she might have gone?
Occur_String5=If she's gone missing around here, she could've been abducted by the Kerus.<br>Human women are a valuable commodity to them.
Occur_String6=Kerus see them as playthings and snacks...
Occur_String7=No! I'll check their encampment.<br>See if you can find more information about her whereabouts.
Doing_String=Linda risked her life to get you out of the forest, even though she'd never met you before.<br>Her kindness is well-known throughout Dudrin.
Completable_String1=You're mistaken.
Complete_String=Linda went missing while she was in the dangerous Weiss Basin, near the Kerus' encampment. She was looking for me to give me something.  She's the woman who rescued me from the Amberial Forest.  I dashed out to the Kerus' encampment,  killed every Keru I saw, and destroyed everything in my path, but I found no trace of her.
List_String=I have to search the Kerus' encampment for any trace of Linda.
Mission_String=Search the Keru Tent and report to Khalif
Mission_Target1=Search Keru Tent 1
Mission_Target2=Search Keru Tent 2
Mission_Target3=Search Keru Tent 3

[Quest_109]
Name=Finding Linda - 3
Occur_String1=You! Linda was looking for you.<br>This wouldn't have happened if she didn't have to find you.
Occur_String2=I came as soon as I heard Linda took off for the Weiss Basin,<br>but by the time I got here, she was already deep in that region.
Occur_String3=The last thing I saw was her footprints headed to the center of the basin,<br>where the Keru Legion has set up camp.
Occur_String4=The Kerus must have gotten her.<br>This is your fault! Your fault!
Occur_String5=Calm yourself.<br>I've checked the Keru encampment. She's not there.
Occur_String6=Really? Oh, thank the gods!<br>Then she could've hidden under the cliff to avoid the Kerus.<br>It's the only place around here that provides cover.
Occur_String7=Please go there and look for Linda. I'm a messenger, but she's not.<br>She's not used to this kind of thing, and she doesn't know this place as well as I do.<br>Please, you have to find her. Promise me you will.
Occur_String8=I can't promise you anything. We're at war, anything can happen.<br>Go back to the city. This place is not safe.
Doing_String=Linda and I have been friends since we were kids.<br>We're of different races, but that didn't stop us from being friends.<br>Our parents used to call us the mascots of Dudrin, where the Dwarves and the Humans live together in peace.
Completable_String1=You came! You came to save me!
Complete_String=Dwarf Messenger Lalla said if Linda wasn't abducted by the Kerus, then she'd be hiding under a cliff somewhere, the only place in the center of the basin where she could hide from them. I went to check the cliff, and sure enough, I found Linda there.
List_String=I have to find Linda, who is hiding somewhere on the rock cliff from the Kerus.
Mission_String=Search for Linda

Name=Rationing
Occur_String1=Hey, aren't you the strange knight who saved Enova? I have an amazing ability to recognize faces. *Ahem*<br>Could you help me out?<br>We've run out of food here at the Western Post. Those Pandemonium bastards cut off our supply routes.
Occur_String2=I came out here looking for food, and now I'm stuck in this place full of monsters. <br>Could you find some food and bring it to the Western Post?
Occur_String3=Don't worry about me. I'll stay hidden. Just get some Fast-growing Mushrooms and bring them to the Western Post.<br>Ah, wait - I might need something else. Um...
Occur_String4=I can get some Frog Beast meat, too. It should be enough food if we also get some mushrooms.<br>I'll let your comrades know where you are when I get there.
Doing_String=Don't worry about me. I can climb the trees if I have to.
Completable_String1=Meat and mushrooms! Wow, thank you so much!<br>We ran out of food, and we've been living on fruit.
Completable_String2=Dwarf Guard Munsei sent me.<br>He's stuck in the midst of monsters on the cliff.<br>You'd better send a rescue party.
Complete_String=Dwarf Guard Munsei told me the Western Post ran out of food. He went out to find food, only to get himself trapped by monsters. I gathered some Fast-growing Mushrooms, hunted Frog Beasts for their meat, and delivered them to the soldiers at the Western Post.

Name=Goblins' Invasion
Occur_String1=Oh. Did you see any Frog Beasts on your way here?<br>The Goblins breed them like livestock,  and use them for hunting purposes.
Occur_String2=Yeah, they're those slimy, disgusting-looking monsters. So they're the Goblins' livestock?
Occur_String3=The Goblins are demons of Pandemonium who were left behind on earth after the Three-year War.<br>They've formed a tribal state on the eastern edge of the Enova Continent.
Occur_String4=They've never invaded us before, but they stirred up commotion near the borders a few times.<br>The presence of Frog Beasts in the Weiss Basin means their owners, the Goblins, are here too.
Occur_String5=The Dwarf Guard must know this.<br>Kind Knight, could you hunt Frog Beasts and bring their heads to the Western Post?
Occur_String6=The post commander, Hertz, doesn't trust contract knights,<br>but he'll believe you if you show the Frog Beast heads.
Occur_String7=Let me take you to Dudrin first.
Occur_String8=Don't worry about me.<br>I'm really good at hiding. You need to go take care of more important things.<br>My grandfather's necklace will protect you.
Doing_String=I hope you'll tell me your name next time... Won't you?
Completable_String1=Frog Beasts, the Goblins' hunting dogs!<br>Well, more specifically, these are their heads. So the Goblins are in on this invasion, I see.<br>Those sneaky demons!
Complete_String=Linda said the Frog Beasts that had been commonly seen on the north side of the Weiss Basin were the Goblins' livestock, and that their presence meant Goblins, the demons that had settled on the MU Continent after the Three-year War, were involved in the latest invasion by Pandemonium. I decapitated some Frog Beasts and took their heads to the Western Post to relay this information.
List_String=I have to decapitate King Frog Beasts and take their heads to the Western Post to prove that the Goblins are involved in the latest invasion.

Name=Burn down the Goblin base
Occur_String1=There aren't many of them yet.<br>Raid them now, and you can wipe them out easily.
Occur_String2=Give us some time to regroup and...
Occur_String3=Raiding is all about timing. Let me handle it.<br>I'll show them hell.
Doing_String=The Dwarf Guard is a militia organized by Sir Duprian.  As you know, the Lorencia Army is supposed to defend Dudrin,<br>but it's unreliable. Sir Duprian has formed the Dwarf Guard to protect the mines here, and that was one of the best decisions he's ever made.
Completable_String1=That was amazing!<br>I could see the Goblin barracks burning, even from this far away.
Complete_String=Linda was right about the Goblins' participation in this war. Shortly after I arrived at the Western Post, an army of Goblins set up camp on the north side of the Weiss Basin. The Western Post, ordered by Dudrin to attack the Kerus' encampment, couldn't keep the Goblins in check. I attacked the Goblin Camp on my own, burning down their barracks and slashing at every Goblin I saw, but that was all I could do. I've stalled the Goblins for now, but eventually they will take over the north side of the basin.
List_String=I should attack the Goblin Camp, burn down their barracks, and kill the Goblins that are building the camp.

Name=Goblin Battle Plans
Occur_String1=But there were too few of them.<br>There aren't enough of them here to call it an invasion...
Occur_String2=They have to be here for the Karmatan Mine, since it's the biggest producer of newk in this place,<br>but yes, you're right - there are too few of them.
Occur_String3=The Karmatan Mine is more secure than ever, now that Commander Duprian and his forces have joined its defending forces.<br>There has to be something else the Goblins want.
Occur_String4=I can go find out.
Occur_String5=Could you steal their battle plans from their camp?<br>That'll help us find out what they're up to.
Occur_String6=Ah, there's one problem:  neither of us speak the Goblin language.<br>Take their battle plans to Vigmund at the excavation site.<br>He should be able to read their language.
Doing_String=It'll take a while for us to regroup and attack the Kerus.<br>Neither the Dudrin Police nor the Dwarf Guard is a regular army - there's only so much we can do.<br>Those cowardly Lorencians, I can't believe they ran out on us in times like this!
Completable_String1=You're excavating artifacts in the middle of a war.<br>Are you crazy?
Complete_String=There were too few Goblins at the camp I raided. I thought they set up shop on the north side of the Weiss Basin to attack the Karmatan Mine, but those I found at the camp couldn't have taken on the mine on their own. I infiltrated their camp, stole their battle plans, and delivered them to Archaeologist Vigmund. He was the only one who could read the Goblin language and find out what the Goblins are up to.
List_String=I should infiltrate the Goblin Camp and steal their battle plans to find out what they're up to.
Mission_String=Steal Goblins' battle plans and deliver them to Vigmund
Mission_Target1=Battle Plans

Name=Goblin Accessories
Occur_String1=I'm Volf, an alchemist. I sell jewelry in Dudrin.
Occur_String2=I came here to find some materials, and now I can't go back home because of the Goblins.  I guess I won't be selling jewelry for a while.
Occur_String3=By the way, I've noticed the Goblins are covered in the finest jewels from head to toe.<br>Do you mind grabbing a few jewels and bringing them to the Jeweller at my shop?<br>I'll pay you handsomely.
Doing_String=Sigh, I don't like being stuck among all these soldiers.<br>I can't wait to go back home.
Completable_String1=Goblin accessories? Eww, they look so tacky!<br>No one wears anything like that anymore, but the gemstones themselves are beautiful.<br>Cut properly, they'll be worth a lot of money.
Complete_String=Alchemist Volf asked me for some Goblin accessories. His greed disgusted me, but he isn't the first one to take advantage of a wartime situation, and he won't be the last. I needed money to maintain my weapons anyway, so I killed Goblins, took their accessories, and delivered them to Volf's jeweler, Olivia.
List_String=I need to seize accessories from Goblin Workers/Guards/Archers, and deliver them to Jeweler Olivia.

Name=Put Together the Battle Plans
Occur_String1=...I can be pretty stubborn when it comes to my job. By the way, who are you?
Occur_String2=A contract knight from the Western Post.<br>These are the Goblins' battle plans. I want you to read them for me.
Occur_String3=This is all torn up.<br>I'm Enova's best archaeologist, and I demand to be treated accordingly!
Occur_String4=They're not torn.<br>I think they were divided into three pieces on purpose to prevent theft.
Occur_String5=I don't care. Put them together.<br>I don't tolerate disrespect, especially if it's from my students!
Occur_String6=What? I'm not your student! Bah, whatever.<br>I'll put them together for you.
Doing_String=What are you doing?<br>Press the 'I' key to open your inventory.<br>And right-click on the Battle Plans to combine them into one.
Completable_String1=Crooked and barely held together by glue...<br>You may be a good fighter, but you're all thumbs when it comes to stuff like this.
Complete_String=That old arrogant coot, Archaeologist Vigmund, declared he wouldn't translate the Goblin battle plans unless I put together the three parts. I thought about breaking his neck and taking off, but I decided against it. Instead, I patiently glued each and every part together and gave the combined battle plans to the old coot.
List_String=The Goblin battle plans are split into three parts for security. Put them together and give them to Archaeologist Vigmund.
Mission_String=Put together the Battle Plans in the Inventory and deliver them to Vigmund

Name=Stop the Attempt on Duprian's Life
Occur_String1=You're trying my patience. Stop yammering and start translating.
Occur_String2=All right, hmpf.<br>Um... "Dear Goblin warriors, it's time we get our revenge. Remember the humiliation we Demons were subjected to during the Three-year War?"
Occur_String3=Wait, just tell me what the Goblins want.<br>Are they really targeting the Karmatan Mine?
Occur_String4=Let me see. Mm...<br> "The objective of the detached forces is to escort Assassin Rosso to the north side of the basin."
Occur_String5=As soon as you arrive at your destination, set up camp and draw the enemy's attention. In the meantime, Rosso will infiltrate the Karmatan Mine and eliminate Dwarf Commander Duprian.
Occur_String6=...!<br>They weren't here for the Karmatan Mine - they're here for Duprian!
Occur_String7=Ramotu Duprian is literally and figuratively the actual leader of us Dwarves.<br>Without him, Dudrin is defenseless against the enemy's invasion!
Occur_String8=Did you say the assassin's name is Rosso?
Doing_String=It won't be difficult to find whoever that Rosso is.  According to some Three-year War documents, Goblin assassins are as big as mountains.<br>They're not stealthy, but they're strong enough to break their target's neck with just one hand.
Completable_String1=Auto Complete
Complete_String=That irritable old coot finally translated the Goblin battle plans, and what he discovered stunned both of us. There weren't many Goblins at their camp because they didn't come for the Karmatan Mine - they came to make an attempt on Duprian's life. I found and killed Goblin Assassin Rosso, whose name was mentioned in their battle plans, but these Goblins weren't the main forces; the main forces were somewhere else in the Weiss Basin. The situation is getting worse.
List_String=I need to go to the Goblin Camp and kill Goblin Assassin Rosso, who has been sent to kill Dwarf Guard Commander Duprian.
Mission_String=Stop the Assassination of Duprian
Mission_Target1=Kill Goblin Assassin Rosso

Name=A Goblin Follower
Occur_String1=H-help me, kind Knight!<br>I'm Felix, the greatest bard in all of Dudrin.
Occur_String2=What's a bard doing in the middle of a battlefield?
Occur_String3=Goblins may not look like it, but they are born romanticists.<br>Before they go out to fight, they inscribe war poems on stone slabs.<br>I came to see if their poems are as powerful and beautiful as people say, and then I got caught.
Occur_String4=They gave me a good beating, but didn't kill me. They said I don't look tasty enough.<br>Anyway, I haven't given up on my goal.
Occur_String5=Could you read their war poems and recite them for me?<br>I'll pay you handsomely.
Occur_String6=Aww, I'm still achy, but at least I can walk now.<br>I'm going to go take shelter in the Karmatan Mine. See you when you get there.
Doing_String=I swear, the Goblins are the world's greatest... oops! Never mind.
Completable_String1=Oh, wow! That's a wonderful poem!<br>"Goblins angry. Goblins kill. Humans, Dwarves.<br>Goblins hungry. Goblins eat Humans and Dwarves."<br>It's flawless! Aww, Goblins!
Completable_String2=(He's not a poet - he's a Goblin follower.<br>He's even wearing his hair like the Goblins do.<br>I'm afraid he's not the only Demon follower there is.)
Complete_String=I met a bard named Felix who was attacked by Goblins.  The Goblins beat him within an inch of his life, but that didn't discourage him from wanting to read their war poems inscribed on some stone slabs.  I read and recited Goblin war poems for him like he wanted.  I thought they were trash, but Felix couldn't stop praising them.  He was a Goblin follower.  The thought of many Demon followers like him made me feel bitter.
List_String=I need to read Goblin war poems inscribed on stone slabs and recite them for Bard Felix.

Occur_String1=Welcome. Thank you for taking care of the Goblin assassin,<br>who was sent to make an attempt on my life.
Occur_String2=Let's just say you're too valuable to die.<br>Anyway, I noticed some horned creatures on my way here.<br>Is there a ranch somewhere close or what?
Occur_String3=Oh, you mean the members of the Bull Horn Legion. They came through the Evil Energy.<br>Evil Energy has been created in many places in the Weiss Basin, so it's hard not to notice them.
Occur_String4=I've heard you failed to mend those tunnels in the Amberial Forest.<br>As long as the Evil Energy remains, the Demons of Pandemonium will come pouring through.
Occur_String5=Anyway, those Bull Horns are up to something.<br>They're hanging around the mine, but they haven't made a move.<br>Something's up. I can feel it in my bones.
Occur_String6=Let me handle it.<br>I'll check their majors and see if I can find anything.
Doing_String=As you know, only a small number of Goblins were sent to kill me.<br>Where are their main forces?
Completable_String1=I checked the enemy majors, but I didn't find anything suspicious.

Occur_String2=You're the trader I met at the Western Post. You wanted me to skin Belbees for you.
Occur_String3=You're alive!? I thought you'd have been eaten by the Demons by now.
Occur_String4=What are you doing here?
Occur_String5=I go wherever a war takes place. Why? Because war equals money!<br>This time, I'm looking to buy Bull Horn Legion equipment.
Occur_String6=It's highly sought after by military collectors for its peculiar design.<br>Can you get it for me? I'll pay you well like the last time.
Doing_String=I don't care if you're a knight, a trader, or whatever!<br>Bring me Bull Horn Legion equipment! I'll pay you good money!
Completable_String1=Wow, you're as good as I remember. Have you thought about my proposition?<br>I mean, about working with me.

Name=Besieged Karmatan
Occur_String1=By the way, I've noticed something strange about their camp.<br>There are statues of a winged man in a black cloak here and there.
Occur_String2=The statues of Demus! They're the wardstones of Pandemonium.<br>Once a demon trap is created by them, no one can get past it.
Occur_String3=So they're trying to isolate us instead of wiping us out.<br>But why? I thought they wanted the newk mines, and Karmatan is the biggest one of all.
Occur_String4=We were wrong.<br>Get out of here before their trap is completed! <br>Go to Police Special Force Member Royce.
Occur_String5=He's hiding on the east side, watching the enemy's movement.<br>He's the best special forces member we've got. I'm sure he's found out something we can make use of.
Occur_String6=What about you? You'll be stuck here once the trap is completed.
Occur_String7=Don't worry about me. Just leave before it's done.<br>Come on!
Occur_String8=All right, but I'll try to get rid of as many wardstones as I can on my way out.<br>You can take care of the rest on your own.
Doing_String=Hurry! The enemy's trap will be completed soon.
Completable_String1=We meet again. Missed me?
Complete_String=The Pandemonium Army was trying to isolate Karmatan, instead of occupying it, by using its wardstones. Dwarf Guard Commander Duprian said once all the wardstones were in place, they would create a dark space trap, isolating the Karmatan Mine from the rest of the world. It means the enemy wasn't after the newk mines as we thought. After destroying the wardstones, I headed out to find Local Police Special Force Member Royce. He's Dudrin's best scout. He should be able to solve this puzzle.
List_String=I have to destroy the wardstones to stop the Karmatan Mine from being isolated, and tell Local Police Special Force Member Royce that the Pandemonium Army's target is not the Karmatan Mine.

Occur_String6=I will go check. Keep an eye out for me, will you?
Doing_String=I'm sorry I can't help you get your memories back,<br>but I promise I'll help you when this war is over.<br>I'm the best scout in the Dudrin Police, you know.

Occur_String3=Check the officers at the Goblins' main camp.<br>They must carry the blueprints with them.
Doing_String=Why are we still here, you ask?<br>We built this mine.<br>We'd rather die than abandon it.

Occur_String4=I hear the Goblins are planning to distribute handouts that claim<br>the association is exploiting its miners.
Occur_String5=That's absurd, but it can still give ideas to some disgruntled miners.<br>Please seize their handouts and bring them to me. I'll pay you as much as you deserve.
Doing_String=Fifty years ago, Enova Continent was a useless, barren land. We at the Mining Association have built the newk mines and brought prosperity to this place.<br>But the Lorencians still treat us like a bunch of hillbillies...

Complete_String=At the request of the secretary to the president of the Zolatu Mining Association, I seized the handouts that the Goblins had made to stir up the citizens of Dudrin.  The message was poorly written, but just the word of its existence was enough to cause panic among the members of the association, which proves they've been too greedy and they know it.

Occur_String1=You won't believe this!<br>Those ridiculous handouts from the Goblins actually worked!<br>Some weaselly miners have stolen newk from us for them.
Occur_String2=Are you sure it's because of the handouts, not because of your stinginess?<br>They could've stolen the newk because the Goblins promised them good money.

Name=Creating Tournament Raid Team
Occur_String1=Finally, the guidelines for the Tournament raid teams have been announced!<br>Join the Tournament and compete against other guilds for territory, glory, and fame!<br>Pit your swordsmanship and magic against others!
Occur_String2=This tournament is not a bar fight. It follows strict rules.<br>All participating guilds are required to elect a raid leader, create a raid team, and compete in matches at certain times.
Occur_String3=If you want more details, Durendal and Gladius in Guild Harbor can help you.<br>They are there to help guilds create and dispatch their raid teams.
Doing_String=Err? Why are you still here? Guild Harbor is southwest from here.
Completable_String1=I'm here about the guild raid team.<br>I was told you could help me create one.
Completable_String2=Welcome. I can tell you've faced more than your fair share of challenges.<br>Any guild is lucky to have seasoned warriors like you.
Completable_String3=The raid team is the representative of its guild in the Tournament.<br>Only guild leaders can apply to create one in the Tournament week.
Completable_String4=If your guild's application is accepted, then it'll be given time to create a raid team.<br>Only the raid leader—usually the guild leader themselves<br>or someone they appointed—can create a raid team.
Completable_String5=Once a raid team is created, you can recruit members for your matches and get ready to dispatch the team.<br>When the Tournament begins, all the raid teams set sail for their matches, which is a sight to behold!
Completable_String6=That's all there is to know about creating a raid team.<br>It may sound complicated, but just try once or twice. You'll get the hang of it.
Complete_String=Durendal told me how to create the raid team. My guild leader first has to apply for the Tournament, and then my raid leader can create a raid team, recruit members, and get ready to dispatch the team.
List_String=I'm interested in the guild raid team. I should go talk to Durendal, who's in Guild Harbor helping guilds create it.
Mission_String=I must listen and learn how to create the guild raid team.
Mission_Target1=Talk to Durendal

[Quest_226]
Name=Dispatching Tournament Raid Team
Occur_String1=Once I create a raid team, then what?<br>Didn't you say I have to join the Tournament?
Occur_String2=Yes. Even if you create a raid team, it'll be no good if you don't depart for your match.<br>Talk to Gladius next to me.<br>He can tell you all about it.
Doing_String=Go to Gladius. He can tell you about how to dispatch your team for the Tournament.
Completable_String1=Seeing that you came to me after talking to Durendal, I assume you want to know about the guild raid team.<br>I can tell you about how to dispatch your team for your Tournament matches.
Completable_String2=Raid teams can be dispatched for their matches in 5 minutes before the Tournament begins.<br>Of course, everyone in your raid team, including its leader, must be present to do that.
Completable_String3=When all the members are ready, then the raid leader can come to me and announce your dispatch.<br>Your raid team will then depart for the battleground.<br>Whatever happens next depends on you and your members.
Completable_String4=The dispatch process itself is simple enough, but there's something you must remember:<br>you cannot dispatch the team once the Tournament begins. You'll be automatically disqualified.<br>And you'll have to wait for another Tournament.
Completable_String5=You're saying I've got only 5 minutes to announce my readiness for dispatch? That's not enough time.
Completable_String6=This tournament is not a street brawl. A lot is at stake for the participating guilds.<br>This time restriction is necessary to filter out those who don't deserve to be in the competition.
Completable_String7=This is called the Trophy Coin. You can donate it to your guild and increase your Guild Trophies, which are required for joining the Tournament.<br>It's valuable. Use it to join the Tournament later.<br>Now, I'll see you when the Tournament begins.
Complete_String=Gladius told me how to dispatch the team for the Tournament. Raid teams must be dispatched within a certain period of time, and those who don't will be disqualified when the Tournament begins.
List_String=I want to know how to dispatch the raid team. I should go talk to Gladius, who's in Guild Harbor helping guilds do that.
Mission_String=I must listen and learn how to dispatch the guild raid team.

Occur_String2=I'm a special agent representing Ohrdor Group. Mr. Dumpain Kerka sent me<br>to check on his farms.
Occur_String3=Currently, the Bredrice Plains are overrun with Pandemonium Army soldiers.<br>It'll be suicidal to go there alone.
Occur_String4=Just tell me where it is. I can fend for myself.
Occur_String5=All right, if you say so.<br>The first farm on the plains is the Ohrdor Group's first farm, Pican.
Occur_String6=Thanks.
Occur_String7=Don't thank me - you're going there to die. It's been less than three years since Ohrdor Group started investing in the Bredrice Plains,

Occur_String3=What can I do to help?
Occur_String4=We need time to get ready to evacuate.<br>Could you take care of the Kobolds around here and buy us some time?
Occur_String5=Sure thing. By the way, the Kobolds have mobilized stone throwers.<br>Why would they need them to attack the plains?

Occur_String3=There are so many farms, it'll take forever for you to check all of them.<br>Why don't you just go to Captain Hanson?
Occur_String4=Who's he?
Occur_String5=He's a Tephakin Army Officer and in charge of noncombatant evacuation operations.<br>It's faster to discuss countermeasures with him than to check on every single farm.<br>He's at the post four looths away from here to the east.
Occur_String6=And could you exterminate some Flying Bugs on your way to the post?<br>These bugs infest grain, but now they've been mutated into monsters that will attack people.

Doing_String=You're not Lorencian, are you?<br>The Tephakinese don't like Lorencians<br>because they look down their noses at the people of their colonies, like Tephakin.

Complete_String=Lionel said the Ohrdor Group owned so many farms that it'd take forever to check on all of them.  He told me I should talk to Tephakin Army Captain Hanson, who was in charge of non-combatant evacuation operations.

Occur_String5=<br>"Strange Slaughterer, you're the savior of Enova, but you could be a threat to this world.<br>You defeated Glasha, but what if you were a puppet of Pandemonium before you lost your memories?"
Occur_String6=Even if that's true, it doesn't change the fact that you saved Enova. I want to help you. Take a few tests I've prepared and prove your good intentions to me.
Occur_String7=If you pass my tests and prove that you're not in league with the forces of darkness, then I'll help you get your memories back.
Occur_String8=Fair enough. Even I don't know who I am - I can't blame him for not trusting me.<br>Now, what should I do?
Occur_String9=The quickest way to turn the tables on the enemy is to find and get rid of the enemy commander, Sezak.
Occur_String10=A copy of his orders to the Kobold Legion might give clues to his whereabouts.<br>This is Zakarian's first test for you:<br>Seize Sezak's orders.
Doing_String=The Kobold Legion is on the west side of the plains, and the Gnoll Legion is on the east side.<br>Knowing how brutal and fearless the Gnolls are compared to the Kobolds, I'm more worried about the east side than this side.
Completable_String1=Here, I've brought Sezak's orders.
Complete_String=I searched the plains for Zakarian, but I couldn't find him. I found his lackey, named Duey, instead. Duey gave me Zakarian's letter, in which he wrote that he wasn't sure if I wasn't a puppet of Pandemonium before I lost my memories. He also wrote he would help me get my memories back if I pass a few tests and prove my good intentions. His first test was to collect Pandemonium Army Commander Sezak's orders from Kobolds and see if they contain clues to the commander's whereabouts.

Occur_String3=What are you talking about?
Occur_String4=Dumpain has taken most of my soldiers to his Black Farm.<br>He must have spent a lot of money bribing the higher-ups.<br>Thanks to him, I'm unable to evacuate his employees.

Occur_String5=Queen Lenavis?

Occur_String6=The Pandemonium Army tricked us all.<br>It pretended to send all its forces to the Karol Kingdom, but it actually went after Noria.<br>Lorencia Kingdom had to make a choice, and it chose Noria.

Occur_String8=Lorencia made the right choice. The coalition obliterated the Pandemonium Army in the Siege of Noria and won the Three-year War, but it was done at the cost of the queen of Karol and her people.
Occur_String9=It's a tragedy.<br>The only thing the Coalition did for Karol after that was build a small tombstone to pay tribute to the dead queen.

Occur_String3=During the Three-year War, the Karol Kingdom stood its ground against the Pandemonium Army, trusting that the Lorencia Kingdom would keep its promise to send reinforcements. Lorencia didn't keep that promise, obviously.
Occur_String4=And the Karol Kingdom was destroyed and disappeared into history.<br>The Dark Reaper is a giant tree grown from the anger of the kingdom,<br>and you poured the holy water of the Lorencia Kingdom onto it.
Occur_String5=That tree grew because of anger!?<br>But Zakarian said it was just an old tree<br>and that it could help purge the land.
Occur_String6=I see.<br>The holy water had spread along its roots and awakened the Karol Knights buried in the ground.<br>Zakarian knew this would happen.

Occur_String6=A girl named Linda who I met in Enova gave it to me.<br>It once belonged to her grandfather, who was a hero of your coalition.

Occur_String4=Orman?
Occur_String5=He's the commander-in-chief of the Pandemonium Army that has invaded Duelden.<br>Sezak and Zakarian competed against each other to win favor with Orman.

Occur_String7=while Zakarian insisted on using reanimated corpses instead.<br>It was the best the Dark Mission could offer, being such a small group.

Occur_String2=Not good. We've lost Canal City, the cradle of the Tephakin Dukedom.
Occur_String3=I don't understand. Why is losing a town so important to you?
Occur_String4=Since the Karol Kingdom fell, we, the descendants of Karol, were scattered across Duelden. For a long time, we barely subsisted. That is, until Ion Tephakin built the Tephakin Dukedom in Canal City.
Occur_String5=In Canal, which was only a small rural village at that time, Ion reunited the descendants of the Karol nobility. He persuaded them to revive the glory of the Karol Kingdom.
Occur_String6=Those who gathered in Canal City elected Ion as the Prince and declared the birth of a state that inherited the artifacts of the Karol Kingdom. And now, that's my country, Tephakin.<br>Canal City is the pride of Tephakinese. It's where our country was born.

Occur_String1=Are you one of them?
Occur_String2=Who are they?<br>You guys in the Alliance are as suspicious as those in the Coalition.
Occur_String3=You're not a Mediahn.<br>Since the appearance of the dragons, the Alliance has set up an investigation camp in our land.
Occur_String4=That investigation group consists of civilians, but they're from Mediah, one of the members of the Alliance.<br>This is their way of getting away with illegal entry.
Occur_String5=I wanted to drive them off, but Dracans Knight Commander Chaisong has approved of their stay.
Occur_String6=(Mediahns? Mediah is the magic kingdom of the Alliance ruled by Kundun.)
Occur_String7=I don't like them, but they're our guests now. I can't let them die.<br>They must have run out of food by now.
Occur_String8=You're a stranger, just like them. Why don't you deliver the supplies to them?<br>I'll repay you generously.
Doing_String=They're civilians, but from an enemy state.<br>I don't know what Chaisong is thinking.
Completable_String1=I'm from the Qwyinan Sentry Post. Here, I've brought you some supplies.
Completable_String2=Thank you, stranger. We ran out of food and didn't know what to do.<br>I can't let these people die, or I'll die too.

[Quest_604]
Name=Studying Dragons
Occur_String1=You Mediahns are in Drapia, which is an enemy state to you.<br>Did you come here to die?
Occur_String2=Of course not. But dragons like those that appeared in Salormis have appeared here in the Ice Lake Plains.
Occur_String3=Dragons have appeared across the borders of the Alliance and the Coalition.<br>They're not of this realm.
Occur_String4=Left alone, they'll become a huge threat.<br>We're only trying to identify them before that happens.
Occur_String5=You don't know what you're talking about.<br>Dragons were created by gods to wipe out their creations?
Occur_String6=(Wait! There has to be a reason why Kundun didn't tell these people about what the dragons really are.)
Occur_String7=Ah... Never mind.<br>Anyway, you civilians can't investigate dragons on your own.<br>Let me help you.
Occur_String8=Thank you. Then could you bring me some dragon air sacs?
Occur_String9=Rumor has it the fire that they breathe comes from their air sacs.<br>We want to verify that first.
Doing_String=I can't get used to this cold weather. And it's getting colder.
Completable_String1=Thank you.  You'll be the first one to know if we find out how they breathe fire.

Name=Heating Methods
Occur_String1=Don't talk to me. It's too cold to open my mouth.<br>I can't get used to this cold weather. I hate it here!
Occur_String2=You're Mediahns.<br>Your country is also on this Litenberg Continent.
Occur_String3=Hmpf,  don't compare us to those barbaric Dracans.<br>Mediah enjoys a mild climate throughout the year, thanks to its superior magic power!
Occur_String4=Well, half of that power comes from Kundun, though...
Occur_String5=(So Kundun isn't just the cheerful, careless guy I thought he was.)
Occur_String6=Knight, could you get us some firewood?<br>The supplies we got this time don't include any, and I feel like I'm freezing to death.
Doing_String=If it weren't for Dracans Knight Chaisong, the Dracans Warriors would've killed us all.
Completable_String1=Wow, I don't think we have enough space for all this.<br>Anyway, now I can warm myself. Thank you, Knight.
Complete_String=I got some firewood and gave it to Silver Sparrowhawks Assistant Researcher Jerry.

Occur_String2=I've heard you've been attacked by the Dark Mission.<br>How bad is it?
Occur_String3=All my friends are dead.<br>Now I can't go back to Qwyinan, let alone get rid of those dragons.
Occur_String4=Aarrggh! Grrr! I'm so angry! This is ludicrous!
Occur_String5=You're not angry - you're scared!<br>You Dracans have a strange way of expressing fear.
Occur_String6=Hmpf!   Do you look down your nose at warriors like other knights because you're a knight too? Is that it?
Occur_String7=Stop yelling! Are you trying to make me deaf? I'll open a path for you.
Doing_String=Grr! Gaaah! I can't believe this!
Completable_String1=I've opened a path to Qwyinan.<br>You'd better get out of here while you can.

Occur_String1=Are you Priest Xelloss? About the statues of the Dark Mission...
Occur_String2=No time for that now! You've got to help me!<br>Dracans Knight Commander Chaisong has betrayed us and put out Bulcan's Brazier!
Occur_String3=Bulcan's Brazier?
Occur_String4=It's a sacred brazier from our creator Bulcan, which was bestowed on Dracans in the beginning of time.<br>Its fire has been kept alive in the altar since Drapia was founded, but that traitor Chaisong extinguished it!
Occur_String5=Why can't you just reignite it?
Occur_String6=The Dracans Altar has fallen into the hands of the Dark Mission,<br>and Chaisong is in league with it!
Occur_String7=The dragons appeared in our land after the brazier died.<br>We're being punished for dishonoring Bulcan!
Occur_String8=(This is strange. I thought dragons were conceived from Neria's Tears.)
Occur_String9=Could you please reignite Bulcan's Brazier?<br>I'm begging you.
Doing_String=The Dracans Altar is only seven looths away from here.<br>You're a knight, so it shouldn't take you long to get there.
Completable_String1=I relit the Brazier.<br>Now, let's talk about the statues.
Complete_String=I went to the Dracans Altar and relit Bulcan's Brazier that was put out by Dracans Knight Commander Chaisong.

[Quest_608]
Name=Collecting Remains
Occur_String1=Those fools... They've betrayed Bulcan for the promise of obtaining a dark power.
Occur_String2=So some of you also have been enticed by the Dark Mission.
Occur_String3=Yes, and as humiliating as it is to admit...<br>Some priests of our creator, Bulcan, are among them.
Occur_String4=Bulcan...<br>You worship him, sort of like how members of the Coalition worship Rugard.
Occur_String5=That's an insult!<br>You can't compare Bulcan to an insignificant deity like Rugard!
Occur_String6=I don't care about any of that religious bickering between you and the Coalition.<br>I do, however, care about the Dark Mission. A lot.
Occur_String7=Now, what do you want me to do about it? It's lured your priests away from your god.
Occur_String8=I'd be surprised if they're still alive.<br>Rumor has it the Mission wants priests for the scales on our bodies as a material for black magic.
Occur_String9=Some of its members must have the scales from my priests with them.<br>Could you bring them to me? I want to give them a proper burial.
Doing_String=Please, at least let me have their scales back.

Occur_String3=The Dracans Warriors in the Poetta Plains base have been attacked by the Mission.
Occur_String4=I know.<br>They went there to get rid of dragons, and the Dark Mission took them by surprise.
Occur_String5=It's regrouping to attack the Poetta Plains base again.<br>The Dracans Warriors can't survive its attacks twice.
Occur_String6=I already secured a retreat route for them, but why haven't they left yet?<br>I'll try to buy them more time.
Doing_String=Dracans Warriors are Drapia's regular army.<br>Although they're considered inferior to the Dracans Knights, they're just as fearless as their superiors.
Completable_String1=I did a number on the Mission, but it's already occupied all of the northern area.<br>This place isn't safe anymore.
Complete_String=I hit the Dark Mission's Chill Zealots who were regrouping to attack the Poetta Plains base again, and bought some time for the Dracans Warriors to retreat.

Name=Unnecessary Worries
Occur_String1=I'm worried about Roy. I hope he's safe.
Occur_String2=Roy? That doesn't sound like a Dracans name.
Occur_String3=No.<br>He's a Lorencian. Somehow, he settled down here as a yak tamer.
Occur_String4=I'm worried the yak breeding camp where he works might have been attacked by the Mission.
Occur_String5=A Lorencian shepherd in the land of the Dracans.<br>It's a serious situation, but I can't stop laughing. I'll go check on him.
Doing_String=Maybe you should settle down in Drapia, just like he did.

[Quest_611]
Name=Feed the Thieves
Occur_String1=I see. Priest Mannu is kind like that.<br>I would've died three years ago if it weren't for him.
Occur_String2=As you know, I'm not from around here.<br>Three years ago, my ship ran into a storm and sank in Litenberg.
Occur_String3=When I woke up, my ship was destroyed and I was surrounded by angry Dracans Warriors.
Occur_String4=I could've been burned alive like the other Lorencians if Priest Mannu didn't stop them.
Occur_String5=He persuaded the warriors to spare me and let me work at their yak breeding camp.
Occur_String6=I'm sorry about what happened to you, but I can't get you out of here.<br>Is there anything else I can do for you?
Occur_String7=There sure is.<br>Ice Boars keep sneaking into the breeding camp to gorge on yak food.<br>We're days away from the next food supply, and we don't have enough food to last that long.
Occur_String8=Sigh... I don't know if I'm a knight or a hunter anymore.<br>I'll take care of them.
Doing_String=Recently, the number of Ice Boars is increasing at an explosive rate.<br>All the Dracans Warriors are away fighting on the battlefield. There's no one else left to cull their numbers.

Name=Breeding Task Report
Occur_String1=I don't want to impose on your kindness, but may I ask you one more favor?
Occur_String2=If you want to send your regards home, then you'll have to find someone else.<br>I have no plans to go to Lorencia.
Occur_String3=You're worried that I'm homesick? I'm all right.<br>These guys are my family now.
Occur_String4=Anyway, could you deliver this list of tamed yaks to the Dracans Knight Encampment?
Occur_String5=I turn in the list every month, and I can't get there this time because the Dark Mission is blocking all the roads.
Occur_String6=I'll do it.  The Dark Mission can attack this place at any time.<br>You'd better move to Qwyinan.
Occur_String7=The Dracans will kill me the moment I set one foot out of this camp.<br>However, I have a better chance of living as long as I stay with them. I'm not going to leave.
Occur_String8=...<br>Stay alive.
Doing_String=The Dracans Knight Encampment is nine looths away to the southeast.<br>The Dracans Knights are rugged and proud Dracans.
Completable_String1=<br>I've brought this from the yak breeding camp in the north.
Completable_String2=Let's see... Um...<br>I don't see any yaks in here that could be used in combat.<br>I don't understand why Priest Mannu wants to keep such a useless guy alive.

Name=Defeat the Chakua Advance Party
Occur_String1=Hey, do you know there are some Dracans Warriors isolated in the Poetta Plains?
Occur_String2=Of course we do. It's so pathetic that they can't handle a group of cultists on their own.<br>This is why I don't trust the regular army.
Occur_String3=The Dark Mission is more than a group of cultists.<br>Those warriors will die if you don't help them.
Occur_String4=Get out of my way, stranger. Subjugating the Chakuas is our top priority now.<br>They've already set up shop and are now a stone's throw away.

Name=A Feint Operation
Occur_String1=You singlehandedly obliterated the Chakua advance party...!<br>We Dracans Knights weren't even ready to enter battle when you did. Who are you?!
Occur_String2=The members of the Coalition call me Strange Slaughterer. Do you need more explanation?
Occur_String3=...!<br>You've made short work of Glasha, Sezak, and Orman.<br>What are you doing here?
Occur_String4=What matters now is that your Dracans Warriors are isolated in the Poetta Plains. Are you going to help them or what?
Occur_String5=We Dracans Knights have to subjugate the Chakuas.<br>That's the order from His Majesty himself.
Occur_String6=I can help. Just promise me you'll help them as soon as we're done with the Chakuas.<br>Now, what can I do for you?
Occur_String7=We're planning a joint operation with the dispatched troops in the south,<br>to attack the Chakuas' base from the north and south at the same time.
Occur_String8=But the other troops haven't received their armament from Qwyinan.
Occur_String9=If you can deliver the weapons to the dispatched troops, then it'll help hasten our joint operation.
Doing_String=You helped the Coalition, but I've always admired your heroism.<br>I'm honored to meet you in person.
Completable_String1=This is heavy. Take it.<br>They are weapons from the Dracans Knight Encampment.

Occur_String2=Well, let's just say I'm cooperating with you.<br>Your main forces want to launch the joint operation as soon as I arrive here.
Occur_String3=Shoot a signal flare, so that your troops at the other encampment know when to attack from the north.
Occur_String4=Wait, something else has to be done first.<br>Our scouts have located the enemy's supply storage.
Occur_String5=It's hidden on the north side of their base.<br>Burn it down, that'll do a number on them.<br>Nothing edible grows on the Chill Plains.
Occur_String6=Pyrotechnics is my forte. I set quite a few places in Salormis on fire.<br>I'll do it.
Doing_String=We Dracans don't trust strangers, and that distrust is ingrained in our genes.<br>But looking at you, I realize not all strangers are untrustworthy.
Completable_String1=I've burned it down. Those Chakuas will have to feed on dirt now.
Complete_String=I set the Chakuas' food supply storage ablaze to break their will to fight.

Occur_String4=They stomp on the surface of the Ice Lake, scaring away the fish.<br>Thanks to them, I can no longer do the one thing I've enjoyed doing since I retired. Hah hah.
Occur_String5=(This means the Evil Energy has been generated around here. The Pandemonium Demons have something planned for this place.)
Doing_String=We Dracans respect those who fight for their country.<br>We can live the rest of our lives enjoying fishing because we served our country when we were young.
Completable_String1=I don't hear many terrapins stomping around.<br>Did you take care of them? Thank you, young knight.

Occur_String5=The dragons near the lake have turned into zombies.<br>I came here wearing makeup to find out why.
Occur_String6=That must have something to do with the Mission.<br>It could have used black magic to resurrect the dragons that were killed in battle.
Occur_String7=Like they resurrected corpses in Karolsandria?

Doing_String=Aww, this place is freezing. It's on the same Litenberg Continent, but its weather is the exact opposite of Mediah's.<br>It's always warm in Mediah.

Occur_String4=while others maintain that they're humans who turned into monsters.<br>Anyway, I want you to get rid of as many of them as you can.
Occur_String5=Why would I do that? I'm not your butler.

Occur_String7=(It might be a good chance to look around the Mu Continent for clues to recover my memory...) <br>Alright, I'll sign it then.

Occur_String1=Knight! The legacy of the lost Wallkreiger Kingdom, the Sanctum of Dragon Knights is awakening.<br>A past legend comes alive again!
Occur_String2=Isn't it good for you Dracans?<br>I heard that the Wallkreiger Kingdom was pretty powerful.
Occur_String3=No!<br>It had its glorious days, but the past must stay in the past. That's how the world moves.<br>But, the darkness swallowed the Sanctum and the providence was broken.

Occur_String2=I'd love to explore the inside of this curious-looking site. Do I need your permission?
Occur_String3=Yes. If you keep a promise.
Occur_String4=How about just letting me in?
Occur_String5=Promise that you'll help us. We Dragon Knights can't leave this sanctum, even after death.<br>This potent magic that has seeped in from the outside is binding us to it.
Occur_String6=Magic? You mean...
Occur_String7=All this happened because we let the magic in. Our desires for strength and new lives have caused this tragedy.
Occur_String8=There's someone inside the Sanctum who is maintaining the magic... <br>Someone named Belgaterm...
Occur_String9=If the magic you're talking about is what I think it is, then I have to do something about it.<br>As well as everything else it might have touched.

Occur_String2=You're barking up the wrong tree.<br>I'm a stranger around here. I don't belong anywhere yet.
Occur_String3=Really? You're an impressive fighter all the same.<br>Do you mind doing me a favor?
Occur_String4=I was one of the few Dracans who had carried the bloodline of the old Wallkreiger Kingdom.<br>We each managed a section of this sanctum before a mysterious group of men intruded and incapacitated us with their wicked magic and ability to control minds. Now I'm the only one who survived.
Occur_String5=….
Occur_String6=But I know this sanctum was sealed off from the outside world and only we had the power to break the seal.<br>
Occur_String7=This means one of your descendants must have used his power to break the seal.
Occur_String8=Yes.<br>Whoever he is, he has to be in league with those mysterious men. He must want to take this sanctum for himself.<br>There's only one person I can think of who is capable of such a thing. His name is Zurataken.
Occur_String9=I haven't recovered from the injuries that I received while escaping. If it wasn't for the injuries... I would have slashed Zurataken myself...<br>I want you to punish Zurataken, the keeper of the sanctum who is in league with the mysterious men, and bring back the sanctum's key that he carries. I'll repay you as best as I can.
Doing_String=Did you get the sanctum's key?<br>Not yet?
Completable_String1=I got rid of Zurataken and found this.<br>Is this the sanctum's key you wanted?

Occur_String1=Like I said, the sanctum is divided into various zones, and there are several keys for each place.<br>In order to manage the first floor with Zurataken's key, you must pass through the statue zone...
Occur_String2=The problem is that the key for the statue zone seems to have been taken away by Zurataken. It's gone from the place where it was stored...
Occur_String3=Luckily, the Wallkreiger descendants have the ability to find the keys, so I could find it right away.... But...
Occur_String4=What's the problem?
Occur_String5=It looks like Zurataken has put the key for the statue zone into a statue. Since he also has the ability to find the keys and knows about it, he must have put the key in a place where we would have to retrieve it by force.
Occur_String6=I've been injured, and I can't retrieve the key from the statue by myself... I need your help. <br>I'll repay you well this time too.
Occur_String7=Then I'll just break that statue and bring back the key.

Occur_String2=But... the second floor's entrance is blocked... There are traps on the second floor to ward off infiltrators...
Occur_String3=Those traps have been made by materializing elementals. They only carry out orders that they are given, so the traps cannot be removed without the key.
Occur_String4=I see... So where is the key?
Occur_String5=It won't be easy this time.<br>I tried to find the key, but I couldn't pinpoint its location. It looks like Zurataken really used his brain this time. I think he hid the key inside someone who wanders around the sanctum. It might be a Ghost Dragon... but there are a lot of them.
Occur_String6=I'll take care of it. I'll just get rid of them all. <br>But, the locations of the hidden keys are so similar. You won't say that the next key is hidden inside the Dragon King, will you?
Occur_String7=No way! No keeper can bother the Dragon King like that. <br>And, someone like Zurataken can't even see his toenails. How would he hide a key inside the Dragon King? <br>Hahahaha. Funny idea.
Doing_String=The Dragon King is the supreme being of this sanctum, and no one can hide a key inside his body.

Occur_String3=No. There are strong dragons inside, and they will open up a new entrance to an unexpected region. And, even though this cave has been known for a long time, it's the first time that dragons have appeared. There must be someone who made the dragons move. I heard a rumor that Garudas could communicate with dragons in the past.

Occur_String7=Hey, I'm a hunter, not a fighter. There isn't much I can do if they both attack me at once. And those Cave Wyverns are so clever. I've been in the cave several times to get rid of them first, but they never come near me when I'm not hunting a dragon.

Name=Evil Energy
Occur_String1=I'm sure the Local Police has talked ill of us to you.<br>Those hillbillies can't see the forest for the trees.<br>The real problem of Dudrin is not those mutant animals.
Occur_String2=Then what else could it be? Are you saying that it's those spider-bitten nobles?
Occur_String3=I'm not finished.<br>Word is that strange creatures are pouring out of that Southeastern cave.<br>I'm afraid that they might have come from Pandemonium.
Occur_String4=Pandemonium?
Occur_String5=It's the Otherworld created by the god of destruction, Sekneum.<br>Two hundred years ago, Sekneum led the demons and invaded this MU Continent.
Occur_String6=After the war that lasted three years, we managed to drive them back to where they came from,<br>but at the cost of half the continent's population.
Occur_String7=If those creatures in the cave are demons, then Pandemonium has returned after two hundred years.
Occur_String8=Now I've got a real mission for you.<br>Go to the cave and identify the creatures in there.
Doing_String=After the Three-Year War, we Humans, the Elves, and the Dwarves drove the demons away from the MU Continent.<br>Later, our three races formed an alliance named the Heraus Coalition.<br>Long live the Coalition!

Complete_String=At the request of Lorencia Army Commander Leo, I went to the Amberial Forest to investigate the origin of strange creatures.

Mission_String=Investigate the Mystery Cave and report to Lorencia Army Commander Leo
Mission_Target1=Discover Evil Energy

[Quest_33]
Name=Prelude to Pandemonium's Invasion
Occur_String1=Those blue waves are Rift tunnels called Evil Energy.<br>Do you remember what I told you last time? The Pandemonium Demons invaded the MU Continent two hundred years ago.
Occur_String2=To come to the Earth, they created Rift tunnels everywhere on the continent. These tunnels are what we call Evil Energy.
Occur_String3=Pandemonium has invaded us again.<br>It's war.
Occur_String4=War? I've just landed in an unfamiliar place with no memories of my past.<br>You're kidding me, right?
Occur_String5=I wish I was.<br>We'd better warn all the members of the Heraus Coalition.<br>Of course, my country first, and then Noria, Mediah, and...?
Occur_String6=Calm yourself.<br>Warning other countries is not something I can help you with.
Occur_String7=Hmm... You can let Noria know. They happen to be here.<br>Head north, and you'll find the Shadow Phantom, the knights of the Noria Kingdom, and their commander Iris.<br>Tell her about the invasion quickly, as you always do.
Doing_String=The Shadow Phantoms are the knights of the Elf Kingdom of Noria. With the Devias Knights of Lorencia Kingdom, they are considered the best knights on the MU Continent. Their commander Iris and I can overcome this difficulty together.
Completable_String1=Hey, this is not a playground for inexperienced knights-errant like you.<br>Get out of here before you get yourself killed.
Complete_String=Leo said the blue waves I'd seen were the Evil Energy,  Rift tunnels used by the Pandemonium Army to invade this realm during the Three-year War.  At Leo's request, I went off to share this information with Iris, the commander of the Shadow Phantom.
List_String=The Evil Energy, Rift tunnels that connect Pandemonium with this earthly realm, has been created in the Amberial Forest,  heralding a Pandemonium invasion.  I'd better go inform Shadow Phantom Commander Iris about this.
Mission_String=Inform Shadow Phantom Commander of the appearance of the Evil Energy
Mission_Target1=Talk to Iris

[Quest_5002]
Name=Destroy the Evil Energy
Occur_String1=I want to get out of here the first chance I get.<br>Lorencia Army Commander Leo wants you to know that the Evil Energy has formed in the Amberial Forest.
Occur_String2=The Evil Energy?<br>Since the Three-year War, the Pandemonium Demons have never showed up on the Earth,<br>too busy fighting each other.<br>Someone must have reunited them.
Occur_String3=Are you talking to yourself or to me?
Occur_String4=I'm sorry.<br>I'm Iris, the commander of the Shadow Phantom.<br>Noria relies on this Dudrin for its newk supplies. Most weapons are made of newk.
Occur_String5=We came here to investigate dwindling newk imports,<br>and have found out that the forest animals are mutating.<br>I've been looking for the cause of their mutation at the request of Commander Leo.
Occur_String6=Have you seen creatures coming out of the Evil Energy?
Occur_String7=Not only have I seen them, but I also killed some.<br>The people of this place call them the Larvas.
Occur_String8=The Larvas... They're the Demons who fought on the front line during the Three-Year War.<br>They're just an advance party.<br>You work for Leo, don't you? Could you do me a favor?
Occur_String9=I believe the Evil Energy is forming everywhere in the forest.<br>Please destroy it before it's completed or it starts letting Demons into our realm.
Occur_String10=In the meantime we Shadow Phantoms will investigate the cause of mutation among the animals.<br>When you're done with your mission, meet me at the Northern Cabin.
Doing_String=Leo is quick-tempered, but brave and upright.<br>If he weren't, he wouldn't have come to this backwater region.
Completable_String1=I've been waiting for you. Did you destroy all the Evil Energy?
Complete_String=At the request of Shadow Phantom Commander Iris, I tried to destroy the Evil Energy that was forming everywhere inside the forest, but for some reason physical force had no effect on it. Soon, an army of Demons will pour out of the Amberial Forest. I can't believe I'm getting involved in someone else's war. With no memories of my past, I'm confused by everything that happens around me.
List_String=I'd better destroy the Evil Energy that is being created everywhere in the Amberial Forest before it lets an army of Demons into this world.
Mission_String=Destroy the Evil Energy and join Iris
Mission_Target1=Try to destroy the Evil Energy

[Quest_5003]

Occur_String1=It didn't work.<br>That Evil Energy can't be destroyed by physical force.
Occur_String2=Soon, Demons will come pouring through it.<br>I suggest you dig trenches along the southern ridges and form an absolute defense line.
Occur_String3=You sound like an officer. Were you a soldier?
Occur_String4=I don't remember.<br>I don't know who I am or how I got here.
Occur_String5=Maybe I could help you retrieve your memories.<br>But can you help me first?
Occur_String6=While you were gone to destroy the Evil Energy, we've discovered the cause of the animals' mutation.<br>It was the Evil Energy.
Occur_String7=What are you talking about? You said the Evil Energy was just the passage between Pandemonium and this realm.
Occur_String8=Yes, it is. And the energy it radiates has triggered Pandemonic changes in animals.<br>Those changes have already spread to the animals in the cave at the south side of the forest.
Occur_String9=Let's go get rid of those mutant animals, shall we? You go first. I'll follow you soon.
Doing_String=The mutants used to move alone, but now they're attacking Dudrin in groups. That means someone's controlling them.<br>But who?
Completable_String1=That was fun.  Except for the Devias Knights, I've never seen anyone as fast as you.<br>I'm a woman of her word.<br>I'll ask Great Sage Zakarian about you.
Completable_String2=Could you continue to help Leo?  For us, that is.<br>I'll come help you as soon as I'm done with my mission.
Complete_String=Shadow Phantom Commander Iris has found out that the Evil Energy is the cause of the animals' mutation. The Rift tunnels that connect Pandemonium to this realm have triggered wicked changes in animals. The changes have spread to the animals in the south side of the forest.

Occur_String3=The Larvas have invaded through the mine tunnels.<br>I thought we'd be safe since you got rid of all the explosives in the Amberial Forest.
Occur_String4=They tried to blast holes into the mine, so they could access the tunnels.<br>I'm sorry. I must have missed a few explosives. Let me help you defend the tunnels.
Doing_String=3rd Company! Stop dawdling or I'll kick your asses!
Completable_String1=Commander Duprian? What are you doing here? You can't be fighting on your own.<br>If you die, Dudrin will fall.<br>You have to be careful.
Completable_String2=You have a point,<br>but someone has to set an example for my soldiers. Otherwise, they'd be too afraid to fight<br>these terrifying demons.
Complete_String=The Larvas in the Pandemonium Army sneaked into the tunnels of the Karmatan Mine while Dwarf Guard Commander Duprian and his soldiers were focused on the outside of the mine. I went down the tunnels with Ramotu and eliminated them all.

Name=Glasha the God of Carnage
Occur_String1=Th-these... Unsealing Stones!<br>Darn it, they're trying to awaken Glasha,<br>who's sealed inside the Heath Mine!
Occur_String2=Glasha?
Occur_String3=He's a Pandemonium warrior who single-handedly wiped out a regiment of the Coalition during the Three-Year War.<br>He was also known as the god of carnage.
Occur_String4=How did he end up in the dead pit?
Occur_String5=He couldn't be killed.<br>The Coalition lured him into the mine and then collapsed the entrance to keep him inside.<br>Twenty thousand soldiers of the Coalition were killed or wounded during that operation.
Occur_String6=That's why they've abducted miners, to dig him out of the dead pit.
Occur_String7=If Glasha breaks out, Dudrin... no, all of Enova... will be destroyed.
Occur_String8=Stop panicking. We can kill him before he does.<br>Leave him to me. You focus on taking care of your wounded soldiers and regrouping the rest.
Occur_String9=You could really die this time.<br>You don't have to do this. Why are you helping us?
Occur_String10=A girl named Linda said I've given hope to many people.<br>I don't want to carry the burden of the world on my shoulders.<br>I want to get this over with, so I can get out of here.
Doing_String=Glasha refused to leave and continued to fight after his army lost the war.<br>He denounced the other demons as cowards for deciding to return to Pandemonium.<br>If he awakens, the demons will be as safe as we are from his wrath.
Completable_String1=The news of your victory has already spread all over Enova.<br>You've saved Dudrin... no, the Enova Continent. Thank you.

Name=To Duelden
Occur_String1=Someone I don't know has saved me from a group of Garuda assassins.<br>...You're the knight who made short work of Glasha in Enova.
Occur_String2=Geez, what are these birds?
Occur_String3=Garudas. They're a member of the Line Alliance. They're usually an enemy to the Heraus Coalition.<br>But us and them have always put up a united front against Pandemonium invasion.
Occur_String4=Seeing that they tried to kill me, the ruler of Mediah, I believe they have joined Pandemonium.<br>I'm just not sure if they're on their own or if the entire Alliance is in on it.
Occur_String5=Sorry, that has nothing to do with you.<br>By the way, what brings you to me?
Occur_String6=Duprian said you might be able to help me find my lost memories.
Occur_String7=Um... I'm sorry, but there's nothing I know about you.<br>I suggest you go to Zakarian. He's a great sage who ruled Noria as a regent for ten years.
Occur_String8=I've heard he's visiting Tempano City on the Duelden Continent.<br>Mention my name, say that I sent you, and he'll be glad to help you.
Occur_String9=One more thing. Could you take a look at this? I've found this from Glasha.
Occur_String10=It's a Evil Crystal. It actually generates Evil Energy.<br>I can't believe you've found this from Glasha.  Maybe we can study it and find out how to destroy the Evil Energy.  Do you mind if I keep it?
Doing_String=Evil Crystals generate Evil Energy,<br>and only legion commanders and high-ranking officers of the Pandemonium Army are allowed to carry them.<br>They simply take it with them and pop the Evil Energy anytime, anywhere.
Completable_String1=Welcome. I've been waiting for you.<br>My name is Midori, and I'm Zakarian's student.
Complete_String=Having been attacked by a group of Garuda assassins of the Line Alliance, the ruler of the Mediah Kingdom, Kundun Mephis, was worried that the entire Alliance might be in league with Pandemonium. I asked him about my lost memories, and he suggested that I talk to Zakarian, a great sage of the Elf Kingdom of Noria. I went to Tempano City, the capital city of the Tephakin Principality on the Duelden Continent, to meet Zakarian.
List_String=Kundun said Noria's sage Zakarian might be able to help me find my memories, and Zakarian would be visiting Tempano City, the capital city of the Tephakin Principality. I should talk to the airship attendant in the Port District and board the airship to the city.

Occur_String4=With your lost memories, you mean? Nothing is impossible for Zakarian.<br>But do you think you'll be happy if you get your memories back?
Occur_String5=It'll be better than not knowing who I am.<br>Why do you ask?
Occur_String6=Ah, nothing. Never mind. I was thoughtless. Zakarian is in the Bredrice Plains. He's looking for ways to fend off the Pandemonium Army.
Occur_String7=As you know, the Duelden Continent is at war.<br>The demons have come to Duelden after they failed to conquer Enova.
Occur_String8=And it's all thanks to you. You killed Glasha and saved Enova from them.<br>Now the people of Duelden are losing their lives.<br>The world is an interesting place, isn't it?
Occur_String9=Well, that shouldn't concern you. You're a stranger after all. You must be more interested in finding your memories than anything else.<br>Now, off you go to the Bredrice Plains.
Occur_String10=Look for where the most intense battle is being fought. He's braver than anyone you know.
Doing_String=I'm not as interested in you as Zakarian, but your determination to get your memories back definitely intrigues me.
Completable_String1=May I ask who you are?

Name=Purging Karolsandria
Occur_String1=He was babbling about something, but he didn't recognize me.<br>I definitely wasn't on his side before I lost my memories.

Occur_String3=The Dark Mission?

Occur_String5=Go to Karolsandria.<br>That place is hell, overrun with walking corpses.<br>The only way to stop them is to purge the land through the roots of the ancient tree known as Dark Reaper.
Occur_String6=Take this holy water blessed by Rugard.<br>The Dark Reaper's gigantic roots coil around Karolsandria.
Occur_String7=Sprinkle the holy water on the Dark Reaper, and the water will run along its roots, purging Karolsandria<br>and sending the corpses back to their graves.
Occur_String8=Why does this have to be my third test?
Occur_String9=To prove that you're not a member of the Dark Mission.<br>Rugard's holy water only takes effect in the hands of those who are under his protection.
Occur_String10=If you're in the Dark Mission, the water will not purge the land.<br>Now, it's time for you to leave for Karolsandria.
Doing_String=The Dark Mission is not like the incompetent Sezak.<br>Supplying soldiers by reanimating the corpses of its enemy? I've never heard of a more brilliant strategy than that.
Complete_String=The Dark Mission has reanimated corpses with black magic to attack Karolsandria. To send the dead back to their graves, I sprinkled holy water on the purging tree, Dark Reaper.

Occur_String7=Of course. The Shadow Phantoms exist for me, you rookie knight.<br>She couldn't stop praising you.

Occur_String3=That's a lie! Why would he collude with those accursed necromancers?<br>Their corpses are no use in this cold weather.
Occur_String4=There's no way Chaisong would be on their side.<br>What threatens Drapia now is the Chakuas, not them.

Occur_String1=I did reset them. They turned back on,<br>but the Dios didn't start moving.
Occur_String2=Yes, it's the same here. This means the problem has nothing to do with the energy repeaters.
Occur_String3=This situation is serious. First Town could be in danger by now.
Occur_String4=First Town?
Occur_String5=It's the main settlement where our chief stays. <br>More soldiers are stationed there than here, but they also rely heavily on Dios.
Occur_String6=Enough time has passed for the other races to have noticed our immobile Dios. It's a good chance for them to attack us.
Occur_String7=You must have many enemies. Without the Dios, you can't keep them at bay. <br>I'll go to First Town.
Occur_String8=You might encounter Gremlins on your way there. <br>They've been waiting for the Dios to disappear.
Occur_String9=I'll take care of them. This place is not safe. <br>You'd better leave as quickly as you can.
Doing_String=By the way, what's the nature of your relationship with Estesia?
Completable_String1=What's a stranger doing here? Security is nonexistent without Dios. <br>Guards!
Completable_String2=
Complete_String=First Town, the main settlement of the Kanturians, also relies heavily on Dios for its security. Enough time has passed for other races to take notice of their immobile Dios and decide to attack them. I cut a path through a throng of Gremlins that had waited for the Dios to disappear and then went to First Town.

Name=Threatening Races
Occur_String1=There's no time for formalities. I've met Estesia. <br>I reset the energy repeaters, but the Dios still didn't move...
Occur_String2=So you're the warrior who saved my daughter Estesia from a pack of wolves. <br>She's back home safe. Thank you!
Occur_String3=I've heard this place is in danger. You have many enemies.
Occur_String4=There's only a handful of us Kanturians in this frozen wasteland.<br>Using the Dios is the only way to maintain our reign over Musai.
Occur_String5=Have you tried to live peacefully with other races? <br>You have all the fertile areas to yourself and that wouldn't have been possible if it weren't for the Dios.
Occur_String6=Don't patronize us, stranger. <br>If our empire didn't fall and we didn't have to live in this barren land, all the ground races, including yours, would've been under our rule by now.
Occur_String7=I'm not from this place. <br>Your threats may work on the Coalition or Alliance, but not on me. Just tell me what to do to help.
Occur_String8=If you're not from Heraus or Line, then what are you doing here? <br>Why are you helping us?
Occur_String9=I'm after the Dark Mission. I'm also keeping an eye on the Pandemonium Army. <br>I came here because I believe the sudden deactivation of Dios has something to do with one of those groups. <br>Let's take care of the biggest threat first. Then we can continue to talk. Which one is your worst enemy?
Occur_String10=The Madas. First Town is built on their land.
Doing_String=The Madas are ruthless savages.
Completable_String1=I've eliminated their leader and obliterated their main forces. <br>They won't dare attack this place, at least for a while.
Completable_String2=
Complete_String=I doubt Kalak ever tried to live peacefully with other races. I eliminated the main forces of the Madas who were especially angry with the Kanturians, because the Kanturians stole their land and built First Town on it.

[Quest_5146]
Name=Different Treatment
Occur_String1=You singlehandedly obliterated the main forces of the Madas... You thought I'd be thankful, didn't you? <br>I know what you want. <br>You want my trust, you cunning scoundrel!
Occur_String2=What are you talking about? Why?
Occur_String3=This is why I refuse to live among ground scumbags!<br>Why did you come here? What do you want?!
Occur_String4=I told you. I'm after the Dark Mission and the Pandemonium Army.
Occur_String5=When our empire still stood, you lived in fear, keeping yourselves beyond our borders. You've grown bold, coming this far!
Occur_String6=I don't know what happened, but...
Occur_String7=Be gone, stranger. I'm only letting you go alive because you saved my daughter's life.

[Quest_5136]
Name=Investigate Southern Town
Occur_String1=I returned home safely, all thanks to you. <br>I've heard you met my father.
Occur_String2=I took care of the Madas for him, but he suddenly turned on me and asked me to leave.
Occur_String3=The Dracans Army has leveled Southern Town to the ground. <br>Drapia has decided to attack us when it found out our Dios stopped working.
Occur_String4=What? No way. I know Dracans Knight Commander Chaisong. <br>He wouldn't do anything so dishonorable.
Occur_String5=But those who burned Southern Town to the ground <br>and butchered the residents were Dracans.<br>That's why my father is so infuriated.
Occur_String6=I know what kind of man Chaisong is. There's no way he would've approved of this invasion. <br>I am going to go to Southern Town and find out the truth myself.
Occur_String7=Then... Do you mind doing me a favor? <br>My fiancée Marongo is in Southern Town. <br>Could you check if he's still alive?

Complete_String=The Dracans Army has leveled Southern Town to the ground, taking advantage of the fact that all the Dios are deactivated. But I know Dracans Knight Commander Chaisong wouldn't do anything so dishonorable. I went to Southern Town to find out the truth and check if Estesia's fiancée Marongo was still alive.
List_String=Go to Southern Town, which has been destroyed by the Dracans Army, and check if Estesia's fiancée Marongo is still alive.
Mission_String=Check if Marongo is still alive
Mission_Target1=Talk to Egon

[Quest_5137]
Name=The Datans
Occur_String1=Calm down. Estesia sent me. This is terrible.<br>I've noticed those who attacked this place<br>looked different than the members of Drapia's regular army.
Occur_String2=They're the Datans, an army serving Prince Woongpam, who was expelled from the Drapia Kingdom.
Occur_String3=Woongpam? Why was he expelled from Drapia?
Occur_String4=He was obsessed with Pectra. <br>He tried to persuade his father to invade us and steal our Pectra.<br>When the king refused, he mounted a coup.
Occur_String5=Dracans Knight Commander Chaisong stopped the coup and Woongpam escaped from Drapia and formed the Datans.
Occur_String6=But why did they destroy Southern Town?
Occur_String7=They took Doctor Marongo, the most renowned Pectra scientist, with them.<br>I saw them dragging him in the direction of the Pectra Laboratory, but I might be wrong.
Occur_String8=(Marongo... He's Estesia's fiancee. I'd better find him,<br>but not before I take care of those who turned this place into shambles.)
Occur_String9=
Occur_String10=
Doing_String=……………….
Completable_String1=I'm helping you. Did Marongo come here?
Complete_String=The Datans are an army created by Woongpam, a Pectra-obsessed prince who escaped from Drapia after his coup was thwarted by Chaisong. They have abducted and dragged Doctor Marongo to the Pectra Laboratory. I headed out to the laboratory to find Marongo.
List_String=Kill the Datans that destroyed Southern Town and head out to the Pectra Laboratory to find the abducted Marongo.
Mission_String=Kill Datans and talk to Mondo
Mission_Target1=Datans Melee Combatants
Mission_Target2=Datans Spear Throwers
Mission_Target3=Datans Magicians

[Quest_5138]
Name=The Cause of Falling Temperatures
Occur_String1=Did something happen to Doctor Marongo?
Occur_String2=He's been abducted by the Datans. Did they come here? <br>They might have passed by here.
Occur_String3=No. I can't believe he was abducted. <br>Everything has gone downhill since the Dios stopped working.
Occur_String4=I reset the Pectra energy repeaters to bring them back up, but that didn't fix the problem.
Occur_String5=Fortunately, the cause has been identified. The Dios stopped working because of ice elementals. <br>We used Dios to control their population, so...
Occur_String6=So you killed them when their numbers grow. No wonder you're surrounded by so many enemies.
Occur_String7=Since Estesia prohibited the control of their population, their numbers have nearly doubled. <br>They're busy laying eggs, even as we speak.
Occur_String8=Are you saying their eggs are keeping the Dios immobile?
Occur_String9=Yes, they're colder than ice. Look how many eggs there are. <br>There are enough to freeze all the Dios' engines. They're the only explanation.
Occur_String10=...<br>I'll get rid of their eggs.
Doing_String=Where did they take Doctor Marongo? I hope he's safe...
Completable_String1=I destroyed the eggs, but the Dios still didn't move.
Complete_String=Mondo said the Datans didn't come to the Pectra Laboratory and that the Dios probably stopped working because of ice elementals. He thought that the sudden increase in their eggs caused by the stop to the population control could have caused the Dios' engines to freeze, so I destroyed their eggs.
List_String=Since Estesia prohibited population control, the numbers of ice elemental eggs have doubled, possibly causing the Dios' engines to freeze. I should destroy their eggs.
Mission_String=Destroy Freezing Elemental Eggs and report to Mondo
Mission_Target1=Destroy Ice Stone Eggs

[Quest_5139]
Name=Western Town in Peril
Occur_String1=Thanks to you, the ground has warmed up. It's enough to thaw the Dios' engines, <br>but they're still not moving. Now I really don't know what to do.
Occur_String2=There's no future for us. The way things are, we're as good as dead. <br>Maybe it's time we pay the price for oppressing others by using the power of Dios.
Occur_String3=Calm down. There has to be a reason. Try to think rationally. <br>You're a scientist.
Occur_String4=Too late. Golems are closing in on Western Town. <br>That town manages the Pectra energy, losing it would mean the end of us.
Occur_String5=Did you also use Dios to control Golems? Wow, you're bold.<br>You shouldn't have messed with Golems.
Occur_String6=They're incomparable to ice elementals and wolves. <br>And the depths of their hatred towards us is also beyond that of any other creature.
Occur_String7=I'll go to Western Town. Tell me the fastest way to get there.
Occur_String8=It's ten looths away to the southeast of here. Meet Chief Kalak. <br>He came from First Town to protect it.
Occur_String9=
Occur_String10=
Doing_String=
Completable_String1=I came from the Pectra Laboratory. I've heard Golems are closing in on this place.
Complete_String=Golems are closing in on Western Town, which manages the Pectra energy. The depths of their hatred toward the Kanturians is beyond that of ice elementals or wolves. I went to Western Town before they got there and talked to Kalak.
List_String=Kalak has come to Western Town to defend the settlement against Golems. I'd better get there before the Golems arrive and talk to him.
Mission_String=Go to Western Town
Mission_Target1=Talk to Kanturian Chief Kalak

[Quest_5140]
Name=Golems' Magnetic Orbs
Occur_String1=I've heard you destroyed ice elemental eggs. <br>It's lamentable that the Dios still don't move, though...
Occur_String2=At least you're not in league with those ground scoundrels. <br>I apologize that I drove you away from First Town.
Occur_String3=It's water under the bridge. How serious is the situation?
Occur_String4=I've got good news and bad news. Which one do you want to hear first?
Occur_String5=The bad news.
Occur_String6=The Golems we used to control with Dios are closing in on us <br>and we don't have enough soldiers to stop them.
Occur_String7=(The Golems are also trying to get their land back. The Kanturians had this coming.)<br><br>What's the good news?
Occur_String8=We've found out why the Dios stopped working. <br>Recently, mysterious orbs have been showing up everywhere in this area.<br>Our investigators have found out they're highly magnetic.
Occur_String9=Magnetic fields interfere with the Dios' reception. <br>Golems must have installed the orbs to get the Dios out of their way.
Occur_String10=I'll try to get rid of those orbs. <br>Save the wounded in Southern Town as soon as the Dios are turned back on.
Doing_String=Estesia thinks our oppressive way with the other races has caused all this, but I disagree.
Completable_String1=I've disarmed all the magnetic orbs of the Golems.
Complete_String=There are not enough soldiers in this place to stop the Golems. Maybe the Kanturians had it coming. The Dios have stopped working because the Golems installed magnetic orbs that interfere with the Dios' reception. I destroyed the Golems along with their magnetic orbs.
List_String=Golems are installing mysterious magnetic orbs around Western Town. Those orbs could be the reason why the Dios stopped working. I'd better destroy the orbs along with Golems.
Mission_String=Kill Golems, operate Magnetic Orbs, and then talk to Kanturian Chief Kalak
Mission_Target1=Con Golems
Mission_Target2=Glass Golems
Mission_Target3=Glass Golem Captains
Mission_Target4=Golem Magnetic Orbs

[Quest_5141]
Name=Reset the Pectra Fusion Reactor
Occur_String1=The Dios still aren't moving, and it's got nothing to do with Golems.
Occur_String2=Their orbs are bombs. <br>They're magnetic, so they can stick to buildings easily.
Occur_String3=We only have enough soldiers to last for three hours, tops. You should get out of here while you can.
Occur_String4=...<br>What's making this Pectra energy? <br>What if there's a problem with its origin?
Occur_String5=That's impossible. Pectra is created in a fusion reactor,<br>and the reactor is located deep inside the Ice Waterfall Cave.
Occur_String6=It's guarded by Dios that have their own power supply. No one can get near it. <br>Except for me, of course, and Senior Scientist Marongo.
Occur_String7=What if Marongo is behind this? He's been abducted by the Datanses.<br> But maybe his abduction is a hoax to cover his association with them.
Occur_String8=What? Are you saying Marongo could have stopped the Pectra fusion reactor?<br>It's possible. It would've been a piece of cake for him.<br>If this is true, he's betrayed his own kind! How dare he!?
Occur_String9=I'll go to the fusion reactor. Hold off the Golems for three hours. <br>I'll see if I can get the Dios moving again in the meantime.
Occur_String10=Thank you. Take this. Insert this key into the control panel of the fusion reactor to reset it.<br>By the way, my daughter is looking for you. Why don't you talk to her before you leave?
Doing_String=You'll have to cut a path through Dios to get to the fusion reactor.
Completable_String1=I hear you were looking for me...
Complete_String=The magnetic orbs of Golems' turned out to be bombs with which the Golems tried to blow up the place. The Pectra fusion reactor, the origin of the Pectra energy, is situated deep inside the Glacier Waterfall Cave. Only Kalak and Marongo have access to it and it's possible that Marongo has betrayed his own kind. If I reset the fusion reactor and bring it back up, the Dios might start moving again. Before I left, I talked to Estesia.
List_String=Talk to Estesia before leaving for the Pectra fusion reactor in the Glacier Waterfall Cave.
Mission_String=Ask the Chief's Daughter why she was looking for me
Mission_Target1=Talk to Estesia

[Quest_5142]
Name=Marongo's Whereabouts 1
Occur_String1=This place could fall into the hands of the enemy at any time. You should leave while you can.
Occur_String2=I'm the daughter of the chief! If I run, who would want to stay and fight the Golems? <br>I'm going to defend this place.
Occur_String3=Good luck. I'm leaving to try to reset the Pectra fusion reactor. <br>It's the last thing we can try to reactivate Dios.
Occur_String4=So you're going to the Glacier Waterfall Cave. <br>Do you mind looking for my fiancée Marongo there?
Occur_String5=Why do you think he's in there?
Occur_String6=He's always wanted to live peacefully with other races. He was never happy about how my father treated them. <br>He also didn't like how dependent we were on Pectra.
Occur_String7=He thought we should give up the Dios and share Pectra with the other races to achieve true prosperity.
Occur_String8=Father thought he was just being idealistic. <br>I think Marongo had something to do with the sudden deactivation of Dios.
Occur_String9=I don't want to believe this, but maybe he wasn't abducted by the Datans, maybe he's trying to share the fusion reactor with them.
Occur_String10=I'll look for him, but if he's a traitor, then he has to be killed.
Doing_String=Marongo... Where are you? Did you really betray us?
Complete_String=Unlike Chief Kalak, Marongo wanted to live peacefully with other races and didn't like their dependency on Pectra. Estesia thought Marongo wasn't abducted by the Datanses, and was trying to share the fusion reactor with them. I arrived at the Glacier Waterfall Cave to look for Marongo.
List_String=Marongo, who was opposing Kalak and his race's dependency on Pectra, could have headed out for the Glacier Waterfall Cave. I have to go to the Glacier Waterfall Cave and look for Marongo.
Mission_String=Look for Marongo's whereabouts in the Glacier Waterfall Cave
Mission_Target1=Arrive at the Glacier Waterfall Cave
Mission_Target2=Enter the Pectra Fusion Reactor Security Office
Mission_Target3=Kill Dio Commander

Mission_String=Reset the Pectra fusion reactor and look for Marongo
Mission_Target1=Explore the Pectra Power Room
Mission_Target2=Reset the Pectra Fusion Reactor

[Quest_5143]
Name=His Misjudgment
Occur_String1=My kind rely on Dios so much, I wanted to teach them a lesson.
Occur_String2=Is that why you stopped the fusion reactor? I've been told that only you could do it.
Occur_String3=I wanted them to feel fear when the Dios stop working. <br>I wanted them to feel how helpless they are without their weapon and facing the wrath of those whom they've oppressed.
Occur_String4=Are you crazy? Thanks to you, Southern Town was leveled to the ground. <br>Most of the people who lived there are dead. Is that really what you wanted?
Occur_String5=I didn't know the Datans would attack. <br>It was as if they knew when the Dios would stop. They attacked Southern Town almost immediately.
Occur_String6=Then they dragged me here and threatened to kill me if I didn't reactivate the fusion reactor.<br>I refused and they left me here to die...
Occur_String7=In the meantime, I reactivated the fusion reactor and they stole Pectra.<br>I've handed the Pectra over to them.
Occur_String8=My Pectra wand! I must get it back!<br>Whatever the Datans are trying to do with the extracted Pectra, it must be stopped! Oh, this is all my fault. <br>Ugh... *Cough Cough*
Occur_String9=Stay with me! Who's extracted Pectra from here? What's his name?
Occur_String10=*Cough Cough* W-Woongpam... Leader of the Datans... the expelled prince of Drapia... <br>Ugh... Estesia... Tell her I'm sorry...<br>[Marongo closes his eyes.]
Doing_String=
Completable_String1=Welcome, knight. Did you find him?
Complete_String=Marongo wanted the other Kanturians to understand fear when the Dios stopped working. Because of him, Southern Town was leveled to the ground. The Datanses dragged him here and threatened to reactivate the fusion reactor. He refused and was left to die. In the meantime, I reactivated the fusion reactor and unknowingly assisted the Datanses in stealing Pectra. I returned to Western Town and informed Estesia of Marongo's death.
List_String=Marongo, who wanted to teach his people a lesson, was betrayed and killed by the Datans. I have to tell this to Estesia.

[Quest_5147]
Name=Marongo's Death
Occur_String1=I'm sorry, but Marongo is dead. The Datans killed him.
Occur_String2=[Weeping] He died? Why? <br>What in the world happened in there?
Occur_String3=He wanted to show you what would happen when you rely on Dios too much, so he lowered the power of the fusion reactor and stopped the Dios.
Occur_String4=But he was abducted by the Datans after they invaded Southern Town. <br>They killed him because he refused to help them steal Pectra.
Occur_String5=He was a fool.<br>He dreamed of a world where we'd share Pectra with other races and live in harmony.
Occur_String6=Thank you, knight, for staying with him until his last moment.
Occur_String7=Try your best to make this place better, so his death won't be in vain.

Name=Extracted Pectra Energy
Occur_String1=Good job. The fusion reactor has been successfully reset.<br>Now, the Dios are warming up. Thank you!
Occur_String2=I've got bad news, though. <br>Woongpam, the leader of the Datanses, ran away with extracted Pectra after the fusion reactor was reset.
Occur_String3=What?! How?
Occur_String4=I saw him extract Pectra with some kind of staff.
Occur_String5=!!!!!!! <br>That's the Pectra Wand! Marongo has handed over the wand to the enemy! <br>That traitor!
Occur_String6=He only tried to teach you a lesson, not to rely too much on Pectra, by stopping the Dios. <br>Woongpam stole the wand from him.
Occur_String7=...<br>How dare that lizard steal our Pectra? <br>We'll level the Drapia Kingdom to the ground as soon as all our Dios are reactivated.

Name=Mad Pure-Blood Supremacists
Occur_String1=I'm %s_9_1. I fought alongside Duprian in Enova and Lunedill in Duelden.
Occur_String2=So you're the famed Strange Slaughterer who defended Dudrin and the Tephakin Dukedom. <br>I should thank you on behalf of the Lorencia Kingdom.
Occur_String3=The Pectra Wand has been stolen. The Kanturians suspect Drapia. <br>Were you involved in it somehow?
Occur_String4=What makes you think that?
Occur_String5=Kanturu has declared it would invade Drapia if the wand is not returned in five days. <br>That's good news for you, isn't it?
Occur_String6=Sure, that's a good enough motivation, but you're wrong. <br>We don't like Drapia. That's true, but we have no intention of playing dirty.
Occur_String7=It could be the Nobility Alliance. Recently, its soldiers have been sighted around here, <br>and there's nothing here that they could want.
Occur_String8=The Nobility Alliance? <br>That sounds familiar. Aren't they Lorencians like you?
Occur_String9=Yes, they are, but they're mad pure-blood supremacists. <br>They extremely hate the members of the Line Alliance. They would do anything to get rid of them.
Occur_String10=I'll go check it out. I'll look for some clues at their encampment.
Doing_String=I've heard you and Chaisong protected Neria's Tears in the Ice Lake Plains.<br>I really want to know who you are.
Completable_String1=I even checked their confidential documents, but there was nothing special.

Name=Missing Scouts
Occur_String1=Was I wrong? I was so sure it was the Nobility Alliance.
Occur_String2=We're back to square one. Who else do you think might want to cause trouble for Drapia? <br>By stealing the Pectra Wand, that is.
Occur_String3=While you were away investigating the Nobility Alliance Encampment, I've received a letter. A party of scouts has gone missing at the Wallkreiger Ruins. <br>What were they doing there? There's nothing but crumbled buildings left from that ancient kingdom.
Occur_String4=I've heard you Devias and the Shadow Phantoms of Noria are considered to have the best knights on the MU Continent, but someone was strong enough to make your knights disappear.
Occur_String5=I have a feeling their disappearance has something to do with this case. Let me go look for them.
Occur_String6=The Nobility Alliance has launched an attack. It's going to start firing the siege cannons soon. <br>They're not easy to avoid. Take a few of my men with you.

Complete_String=Some members of the Devias Knights have gone missing while scouting the Wallkreiger Ruins. Someone was strong enough to make such competent knights disappear. I had a feeling their disappearance had something to do with the missing Pectra Wand, so I fought my way through the Nobility Alliance's barrage of cannonballs and got to the south scout party.

Occur_String1=The army of the Wallkreiger Kingdom has been resurrected. Someone awakened it, <br>and it got our scouts.
Occur_String2=The Wallkreiger Kingdom? I heard that's the ruined site of the ancient kingdom.
Occur_String3=That's right. Wallkreiger is the Dracans Kingdom destroyed by Pandemonium during the Three-Year War.
Occur_String4=That reminds me of the Karol Kingdom. <br>Karol fell also during the Three-Year War and its descendants built the Tephakin Dukedom.
Occur_String5=That's right. Drapia is founded by the descendants of Wallkreiger.<br>By the way, how do you know about the Karol Kingdom?
Occur_String6=I fought alongside the Tephakin Army in Karolsandria.
Occur_String7=So you're the legendary knight! I'm sorry I didn't recognize you.
Occur_String8=That's exactly what happened to Karolsandria. Revenants returned and butchered the living. <br>The Dark Mission must have done this.
Occur_String9=Will you go check? You've fought revenants brought back by the Mission once.

Name=Disrupting the Ritual
Occur_String1=Black magic. It was the Dark Mission that woke up the Wallkreiger revenants, just like I thought. <br>Zakarian, that bastard! You're a bookworm, not a soldier. <br>Go back to your headquarters while you can.
Occur_String2=I'm not just a bookworm! I have a PhD in history! Plus, I've had basic combat training.
Occur_String3=Alright! I saw the revenants stand in a circle performing some kind of ritual. <br>They screamed "Kaisar." Do you know what that means?
Occur_String4=Kaisar means father in the Dracans language.
Occur_String5=!!!!!!!! <br>The revenants of Karolsandria screamed mother to wake up their queen Lenavis. That's why that circle looked so familiar.
Occur_String6=Then the father must mean the last Wallkreiger emperor who died during the Three-year War. The revenants are trying to wake him up.
Occur_String7=We'd better stop them before they finish their ritual.

Occur_String5=I'd better go warn Muren at the Devias Army Headquarters.
Occur_String6=Well... I've just received news that the Nobility Alliance is laying siege to the headquarters using trebuchets. <br>Going there is suicide.
Occur_String7=Bookworm, your duty is to study. My duty is to fight. Don't worry about me. Take care of yourself.

Name=Lorencia Royal Army Western Deployment
Occur_String1=I was late. All of them must have been killed or turned into revenants by now. <br>I saw that happen too many times in Karolsandria.
Occur_String2=I can't just watch some accursed ghosts kill off a whole brigade! <br>Get out of my way! We Devias will take care of them ourselves!
Occur_String3=I've met many people in Karolsandria who acted just like you and ended up dead. <br>You don't have enough men to handle the revenants. Be rational!

Occur_String6=Even the Devias Knights can barely handle those revenants. There's no way you could beat them.

Name=To the Sanguine Highlands
Occur_String1=I still don't understand why the Mission awakened the Wallkreiger revenants.
Occur_String2=To get rid of you Devias, maybe, because it wanted the Wallkreiger Ruins.
Occur_String3=I haven't seen a single Mission in this area. They left right after they woke up the revenants with black magic.<br>If they wanted this place, then they would've shown up to attack us.
Occur_String4=…………. <br>What if the revenants were a distraction to keep you here <br>while they were scheming something somewhere else?
Occur_String5=That's possible. <br>The Mission could be the one that commissioned Woongpam to steal the Pectra Wand for whatever plans they've cooked up.
Occur_String6=And it would've needed time to avoid you, me, and Chaisong.
Occur_String7=Their plan worked. We've been so busy dealing with the revenants, <br>we completely forgot about the Pectra Wand.<br>Woongpam must have stolen the Pectra Wand for the Dark Mission.

Occur_String5=Are you saying you're here to clean the bloodstains?
Occur_String6=You're so impatient, aren't you? <br>I'm here to investigate the rumor that all this blood is making the creatures of this place violent.

Occur_String1=You made it in time. <br>You know today is the last day for you to get me the Pectra Wand, don't you? Did you find it?
Occur_String2=There you go. <br>Woongpam stole this for Pandemonium and it had nothing to do with Drapia.
Occur_String3=I see. Pandemonium... <br>Its army never invaded my territory. Why would it want the wand? <br>Where's the other wand?
Occur_String4=What do you mean? I've brought Marongo's Pectra Wand.
Occur_String5=Marongo had a pair of wands. <br>He crossed the wands to generate Pectra and use it to keep wild animals warm.
Occur_String6=You're kidding me! That means the other one is still in the hands of Pandemonium. <br>Those bastards! I thought I was finally done with them!
Occur_String7=Word is that the War Shelter is undergoing rapid Pandemonic changes. <br>The other wand might have something to do with that.
Occur_String8=(The War Shelter is undergoing Pandemonic changes? <br><br>That must be their endgame. The Prison Camp was just a feint!)
Occur_String9=I'll go to the War Shelter. I'll get the other wand. <br>You're not going to attack Drapia in the meantime, are you?
Occur_String10=You must think I'm a vindictive old coot. <br>Here, take this Pectra crystal. It's small but it will be very useful when you need help.<br>May Akneria bless you.
Doing_String=You don't know how to get there, do you? Use the Travel Gateway to get to the Sanctum of the Elders. <br>The War Shelter is past Snow Mountain.
Completable_String1=%s_9_1! %s_9_1 has come to help us!
Complete_String=Before I started looking for the other Pectra Wand, I first had to check the progress of the Pandemonic changes in the War Shelter. I went there and was greeted by a large number of refugees who left their homes to avoid the Pandemonic changes.
List_String=It turned out Woongpam stole two Pectra Wands. Kalak said the War Shelter was undergoing rapid Pandemonic changes. I'd better get there quickly.
Mission_String=Move to the War Shelter that is undergoing Pandemonic changes.
Mission_Target1=Arrive at the War Shelter

Occur_String1=Do you know me?
Occur_String2=Who doesn't? Everyone in Litenberg knows you, %s_9_1! <br>You've saved this world from the Pandemonium Demons in the Ostlich Prison Camp.
Occur_String3=That's not entirely true. I've heard this place is undergoing rapid Pandemonic changes.
Occur_String4=Not only that, the Pandemonium Army has also invaded it. <br>Sir Chaisong has ordered us to move to Qwyinan, so that's what we're doing.
Occur_String5=Where's Chaisong?
Occur_String6=He's at the Union Headquarters. <br>Well, I'm not too happy about us working with the Lorencians.
Occur_String7=(Chaisong and Muren have united again. They're great commanders.)
Doing_String=I bet no one in Drapia is more famous than you are.
Completable_String1=
Complete_String=While investigating Pandemonic changes in the area, I discovered its habitants were also affected by them: Ice Shamas have grown to be an enormous size.
List_String=Chaisong has arrived here before me. He's at the Union Headquarters and I assume he's with Muren. I'd better get there and investigate the Pandemonic changes in this area along the way.

[Quest_5268]
Name=Unexpected Reunion
Occur_String1=I'm glad to see you again but things are not good. <br>It's good to see the Coalition and the Alliance work together again, though.
Occur_String2=As you might have noticed on your way here, this place is undergoing rapid Pandemonic changes.
Occur_String3=The Prison Camp was just a feint.
Occur_String4=And we don't know what the enemy is really up to.

Occur_String6=
Occur_String7=
Doing_String=
Completable_String1=Tephakin Dukedom Successor Kali...

Occur_String1=
Doing_String=
Complete_String=I injected the Evil Energy with Pectra and witnessed a drastic change in it.

Occur_String1=
Doing_String=
Completable_String1=It expanded so fast. It went out of control! That was close.
Complete_String=The Evil Energy, having been injected with Pectra, expanded itself and spewed out Pandemonium soldiers. They were unfortunate, however, that they encountered veteran warriors like Muren, Chaisong and Kali as their first enemy. They were totally destroyed along with the Evil Energy before they set foot upon this world.
List_String=As soon as I injected the Evil Energy with Pectra, Pandemonium soldiers came surging out of it. I'd better get rid of them and the Evil Energy before it releases more enemies.
Mission_String=Destroy the Evil Energy before it releases more enemies

Mission_Target2=Kill the Pandemonium Special Forces Captain
Mission_Target3=Destroy the Evil Energy

[Quest_5244]
Name=Kanturian Hermit
Occur_String1=A tiny crystal triggered such a violent reaction from the Evil Energy. I don't know what a large amount of Pectra can do to it.
Occur_String2=It will probably create a big tunnel between Pandemonium and Earth.<br>But you retrieved the Pectra Wand from the Demons.
Occur_String3=They had one more. It turned out they stole two wands from Marongo.
Occur_String4=Oh, no! Qwyinan is a stone's throw from here. <br>It'll be the end of Drapia if the tunnel is created here.
Occur_String5=Drapia won't be the only one going down. So will Mediah. <br>And so will all of Litenberg.
Occur_String6=The Prison Camp was just a decoy to distract us. <br>We've been fooled. Do you know if there are Kanturians living somewhere near here?
Occur_String7=There's one living in seclusion south of here. <br>It's been said he left his tribe because of a conflict with his chief. But why?
Occur_String8=Not now. I'll explain this to you later. Bye.
Occur_String9=
Occur_String10=
Doing_String=………………….
Completable_String1=I don't care what you have to say. Leave.
Complete_String=I needed Kanturu technology to locate the Evil Energy. Fortunately, I found a Kanturian hermit living south of the War Shelter, but the Kanturian hermit, Wake, refused to help me despite the dire situation.
List_String=The Evil Energy, if injected with a large amount of Pectra energy, will create a giant tunnel. A Kanturian hermit is living south of this place. I should go borrow Kanturu technology from him.
Mission_String=Talk to the Kanturian Hermit
Mission_Target1=Talk to Wake

[Quest_5245]
Name=Necessities for the Restoration
Occur_String1=You Kanturians are capable of measuring the Pandemonic Energy, aren't you? Help me find where it's at its thickest.
Occur_String2=I said I don't care. I'm not interested in the outside world—leave me alone!
Occur_String3=Can't you see this place is turning into a smaller version of Pandemonium? <br>A giant tunnel that connects Pandemonium and Earth is being built in it as we speak.
Occur_String4=When the tunnel is completed, the entire continent will turn into another Pandemonium. <br>Then you won't have a place to live!
Occur_String5=…………. <br>I can't believe I'm doing this again. <br>I'm not doing anything else, got it? Bring me scorpion oil.

List_String=It took a while but I was able to convince Kanturian hermit Wake to activate his Pandemonic Energy meter. He needs some Crystal Tail Scorpion oil to turn on the meter. I'd better get it now.
Mission_String=Collect Scorpion Oils and deliver them to Wake
Mission_Target1=Crystal Tail Scorpion Oils

[Quest_5246]
Name=Measuring Pandemonic Energy
Occur_String1=This meter has to be lubricated first before it can be turned on. Add the scorpion oil to the Pandemonic Energy Meter.
Doing_String=Did you not understand me? It has to be lubricated first before it can be turned on. <br>Add the scorpion oil to it now.
Completable_String1=I haven't used it for a long time. I'm glad it's working.
Complete_String=Scorpion oil is used to lubricate the Pandemonic Energy meter. I added the oil and turned on the meter. I was all thumbs when it came to machines but it was easy to operate.
List_String=Scorpion oil is used to lubricate the Pandemonic Energy meter. Add the oil to the meter and check if it runs smoothly.
Mission_String=Add Collected Scorpion Oil to the Pandemonic Energy Meter

[Quest_5247]
Name=To the Grain Storage
Occur_String1=It's measuring. Let's see... <br>There's one source of energy in the east... They're Gremlins... The really strong sources are these two here.
Occur_String2=Two caves in the north are releasing an immeasurable amount of Pandemonic Energy. <br>Pandemonic changes are spreading from those two places.
Occur_String3=(One of them has the Evil Energy Tunnel being built inside it.) <br><br>You've been very helpful. I'll get out of your hair now.
Occur_String4=Wait, these Gremlins. <br>They're moving to the grain storage where my daughter is!
Occur_String5=Your daughter? I thought you were a hermit living alone.
Occur_String6=I hated Kalak so much that I left Kanturu ten years ago. <br>My daughter is the only thing that keeps me in this barren land. <br>Please save her. Please!
Doing_String=Head east and you'll see the grain storage soon. Please hurry!<br>Please!
Completable_String1=Let me die without pain, grounder.
Complete_String=The Pandemonium Army could inject the Evil Energy with Pectra anytime and launch a large-scale attack, but I couldn't ignore Wake's plea to save his daughter. I found her lying dead in the midst of Gremlins.
List_String=I was about to leave to let the others know the Pandemonic Energy was at its thickest in the two northern caves when Wake pleaded with me to save his daughter from Goblins. I should go to the grain storage and find her.
Mission_String=Look for the Kanturian Hermit's daughter
Mission_Target1=Look for Wake's Daughter

[Quest_5248]
Name=Thorough Revenge
Occur_String1=This is for the dead girl. <br>Sigh...
Occur_String2=You killed my comrades before my eyes. What makes you different from us? <br>Besides, we didn't kill her.
Occur_String3=You're just lying to save yourself.
Occur_String4=Think whatever you want. Commander Hero killed her. <br>He told us to pillage this grain storage and that was all we did.
Occur_String5=Not all Demons are cruel. That's just your prejudice. <br>We were dragged into this mess to be porters to the others.
Occur_String6=...<br>Where's Hero now?
Occur_String7=He headed out to the battle lines. Do you have a map? I can mark his location for you?
Doing_String=Why, have you changed your mind?
Complete_String=Gremlin Kapucha pointed me to a place filled with Gremlins. At first it was a Keru that fooled me, and now a Gremlin. Once again I got tricked into an ambush.
List_String=Unfortunately, Wake's daughter was killed by Gremlins. I interrogated one of them and he pointed me toward their commander's location. I'd better go there.
Mission_String=Move to where the Gremlin pointed out for the dead girl's revenge
Mission_Target1=Arrive at the Place that Kapucha Mentioned

Name=Commander Hero
Doing_String=
Completable_String1=
Complete_String=I eliminated all the Gremlins at the grain storage, but her revenge would not be completed until I kill their commander Hero, who ordered her death. I searched every nook and cranny of the lake and eliminated Ice Gremlin Commander Hero at last.
List_String=The Gremlin pointed me to a place filled with other Gremlins. The lake looks suspicious. I'd better go there and look for their commander.

[Quest_5250]
Name=Exposed Neria's Tears
Occur_String1=The Kanturian said the Pandemonic Energy is thicker inside the northern cave. <br>The eastern one could be a feint, like the Ostlich Prison Camp was.<br>The Evil Energy Tunnel has to be being built inside the northern cave.
Occur_String2=...<br>Let me tell you the truth: Neria's Tears are hidden inside the eastern cave.
Occur_String3=So the Neria's Tears in the Closed Waterway wasn't the only one.
Occur_String4=This was supposed to be a secret... <br>Now those two will know.
Occur_String5=The Pandemonic Energy is wearing down the ward around the Neria's Tears. <br>It'll be a matter of time before it falls into the hands of Pandemonium.
Occur_String6=That'll be a lucky find for the enemy. <br>Phew... I'll collect Neria's Tears. You take your soldiers to the northern cave and look for the Evil Energy Tunnel. I'll follow you soon.
Occur_String7=Thank you, %s_9_1. My daughter Kelbra is in Wartopa Temple. <br>She'll help you.
Doing_String=I don't see why you wouldn't, but please bring Neria's Tears to me, %s_9_1.
Completable_String1=We meet again.
Complete_String=Chaisong said more of Neria's Tears were hidden inside the eastern cave, and they had to be retrieved before the Pandemonic Energy wore down the ward around it. As Chaisong suggested, I went to the Wartopa Temple and asked his foster daughter Kelbra for help.
List_String=Chaisong said more of Neria's Tears were hidden inside the eastern cave, and the Pandemonic Energy is wearing down the ward around it. His foster daughter Kelbra is in the Wartopa Temple. I should go ask her for help.

Occur_String2=I have to agree. And that was just the beginning of this whole ordeal. <br>Now I need to retrieve Neria's Tears. Your father said you could help me.
Occur_String3=Not right now. I've got something else to do.
Occur_String4=Neria's Tears is a toy of the gods that enables whoever collects all five pieces to summon a black dragon. <br>What else can be possibly more important?
Occur_String5=The procession of refugees heading for Qwyinan is vulnerable to Pandemonium's attacks. <br>They may not be of the same race as I, but I'm Chaisong's foster daughter. I must protect them.
Occur_String6=I'll take care of them. You just get ready to leave with me.
Doing_String=Why are you looking at me like that? Do you find it still strange that I'm adopted by Chaisong?
Completable_String1=(I'm late. She's badly injured.)<br><br>Can you stand up? Let me help you.
Complete_String=Retrieving Neria's Tears was the most urgent priority, but Kelbra was worried that the Dracans refugees were vulnerable to Pandemonium's attacks. I decided to go check on them while she got ready to leave with me. But by the time I found the refugees, all of them were dead.

Name=A Surviving Baby
Occur_String1=It's too late for me now. Could you bring my baby to Kelbra?
Occur_String2=She may be Chaisong's daughter, but she's not of the same race as you. <br>I don't think she's a suitable guardian for your child.
Occur_String3=Kelbra has taken good care of us nomads in this land. <br>She cares about us Dracans more than anyone else. I can trust her with my baby.

Occur_String4=She's Moiring's daughter. Poor baby... <br>She's left alone in this cold land...
Occur_String5=I don't want to sound apathetic, but we have to leave for Neria's Tears.
Occur_String6=I can't leave her in the temple. You should go first. <br>I'll follow you with some Dracans Knights.
Doing_String=Didn't you say you were in a hurry?
Complete_String=I delivered Moiring's baby safely to Kelbra. I arrived at the Pandemonic cave to retrieve Neria's Tears. I found the Pandemonium Army was already in the Neria's Tears Storage, ready to take the Tears with it.

Occur_String2=If the Pandemonium Army finds them, they'll die painful deaths. <br>Could you help them die peacefully?
Occur_String3=Please get some poison mushrooms, so the patients can eat them and die peacefully.
Doing_String=Poison mushrooms can thrive even at the coldest temperature. You won't have a hard time finding them.
Completable_String1=Thank you, stranger. I know this is sad, but it's the best for them.
Complete_String=Ideally, it'd be best if I got to the northernmost battle line as soon as possible, but things always don't go so smoothly. The only thing I could do for the patients was to get some poison mushrooms, so they could die peacefully instead of being killed by the Pandemonium Demons.

Occur_String3=I'd better hurry, so I can catch up with them.<br><br>(I'd better join the Union before the Evil Energy Tunnel is completed.)

Occur_String2=You should be! Three more seconds, and all four of us could've been dead!
Occur_String3=Sorry. I had to find out how to destroy the Evil Energy Tunnel.
Occur_String4=Is that why you needed dragon skulls? The Silverfel Knights were collecting them for you.
Occur_String5=Yes. For some reason, dragon remains have the power to destroy the creations of Pandemonium.<br>Of course, they can't destroy the Evil Energy Tunnels by themselves.
Occur_String6=I'm sure dragon skulls are nothing but gigantic reptile bones without your magic to awaken their power.<br>You're impressive.
Occur_String7=I'm flattered. I just destroyed the Evil Energy Tunnel.<br>It's you who united the Coalition and the Alliance. You did something that no one else could.
Occur_String8=Go to Chaisong. He has an important announcement to make. Get ready to be surprised.

Occur_String5=I'm sorry, but our orders are to collect Ghost Dragon's skulls, <br>and His Grace is expecting you to help us.
Occur_String6=You want to study dragons now?! You can't possibly think Mediah will be safe if the tunnel is completed.
Occur_String7=Kundun is the greatest sage on the MU Continent. Everything he does, he does for a reason. <br>It's up to you to believe him.  Are you going to help us or not?
Doing_String=Dragon skulls are heavy. Please be careful.
Completable_String1=Here, take these. I hope your leader knows what he's doing.

Occur_String4=Um... Ah... I just feel bad for you. Why are you helping us, %s_9_1? <br>All this has nothing to do with you.

Occur_String4=You talk as though you've always asked if I can actually do something. What do you need?
Occur_String5=Oh, I like your positive attitude.<br>Every time you made a fuss, the Rift warped little by little.<br>I think it will be fun to accumulate those warps, and... BOOM! Make them explode all at once.
Occur_String6=Defeat as many monsters as you can in a Rift similar to the one you went last time.<br>In order to get the result I want... let's see... 250 monsters?<br>That should be enough to warp the Rift as much as I calculated.
Doing_String=If we can collect the Rift Warps and make them explode, the Rift will shake, and then the energy from there will be... hmm... the frequency... the vector...

Occur_String7=There's a rule like that in your Research Society? It looked like the others didn't care at all...<br>Anyway... how did you come out?
Occur_String8=The Rift is filled with energy that was created when time and space warped.<br>It's called the Rift energy, and if you are exposed to it for a long time, you will experience changes in your body and mind.<br>My brother saw my condition and told me to come out first.

Occur_String2=Like I said last time, if you stay in the Rift for a long time, you'll be exposed to the Rift energy.<br>At first you'll just feel dizzy, but eventually your body will mutate and you'll be stuck in the Rift.<br>In other words... you'll become a monster.

Occur_String2=There's one arrogant genius in our Rift Research Society, and maybe he's the only one who could explain your unique... durability? or something like that.
Occur_String3=And... I have no idea how long you could withstand the Rift energy...<br>Even though I thought I had done a lot of research.
Occur_String4=Well, don't be discouraged. Maybe I'm just one strange species.
Occur_String5=That's right! If I get discouraged, nothing will be solved. So, Knight!

Occur_String3=Really? Then I'll count on your body. Let's go inside a Rift with more powerful warps!
Occur_String4=Rifts with powerful warps have even greater Rift energy, so one can't stay in there long at all.<br>We've only done very fragmented research until now, but with your strong body, you should have no problem!
Occur_String5=So, I just need to stay there until I feel dizzy?
Occur_String6=No. Just do the same. It's just that you are going into a Rift with more powerful warps.<br>If you go and stay longer on purpose, the conditions of the research will be different so it won't be objective.

Occur_String3=As you saw, the Rifts are in various regions, and the places that are connected to them are all different.<br>That's why the Rift Research Society goes from region to region to do research.
Occur_String4=That's why the people at the Rift Research Society are all scattered.<br>It's because we want to see the Rifts in various regions.
Occur_String5=I was able to do a lot of research thanks to your strong body.<br>Once I finish this investigation, I should be able to settle the research that is being conducted outside.<br>Taking the data found outside and confirming it inside is a little easier.

Occur_String3=I'm actually so happy I might go crazy…<br>but I'm trying to stay calm.<br>My heart is about to explode with happiness. *Deep breaths*
Occur_String4=……
Occur_String5=Knight. I need more Essences. I need more Essences... a lot more... Wheee!<br>I sold the medicine I made with the Essences you brought last time for a tremendous sum!<br>I am raking in the money!
Occur_String6=Knight! Get moving! Don't you want to become rich?<br>If you bring the Essences, both you and I will make a fortune!<br>Please bring more than last time! A lot more! Much more!
Occur_String7=Alright, got it. Got it. I'll be back, so stay quiet.<br>Phew... I'm getting tired of this.

Occur_String2=Hm? What is it now? You sure seem calm.
Occur_String3=How rude!<br>I may have looked like I had a screw loose, but I'm basically a researcher.<br>My priority is intellectual research.<br>Of course, I like shiny things a little.
Occur_String4=...You had more than one screw loose, and you like shiny things more than a little.
Occur_String5=*Ahem* What are you saying to a lady like me? Anyway, I have a request.<br>I looked closely at the Essences you brought, and they seemed to all have different attributes.<br>I believe they can be used differently.
Occur_String6=It will be very helpful if you can bring me essences from various environments.<br>I want to see the ones from Skywind Square, Lava Cave Area, and Glacier Cave Area.<br>I want to take a look at the essences from those three places.
Occur_String7=I don't need many... so maybe three? Please bring me three of each.<br>We don't know where the Rift might connect to, so if you are unlucky you might have a hard time...<br>But I'll make sure to reward you generously. I'm counting on you.
Doing_String=Should I tell you again?<br>It's Skywind Square, Lava Cave Area, and Glacier Cave Area.<br>Good luck.
Completable_String1=Thank you, Knight. You came back faster than I thought.<br>I'll look into the essences. It might take a while...<br>But thinking about the money I can earn with these...<br>Wheee! I'll become the richest person on the Mu Continent! Gold! Treasures!
Completable_String2=...I knew it.<br>You have more than one screw loose and you like money more than a little.

Occur_String1=I've been waiting for you. Brave Knight.<br>You will receive Rugard with your indomitable body...
Occur_String2=Whoa...<br>I'm sorry, but I have no interest in your religion.
Occur_String3=Hahaha, I'm not playing with religion. Since the Endless Tower was really built by gods.
Occur_String4=A tower, huh. So they don't have time to help people in need, but have time to build a tower...
Occur_String5=The Endless Tower was built even before there was history.<br>And only a few priests who received the oracle go around to find skilled knights who will climb the tower.<br>If you are doubtful, you can reach the top of the Endless Tower and have an audience with god Rugard to resolve your doubts.
Occur_String6=Even I, a stranger who has lost his memory, can see a lot of people suffering.<br>But this so-called god builds a ridiculous tower and the only way to see him is to crawl up the tower?<br>Is he worthy of being called a god?
Occur_String7=How impertinent! There's a reason behind everything a god does.<br>We are not worthy to determine his intentions.<br>If you really think that way, why don't you go and have an audience with him yourself?
Occur_String8=Phew... alright. I'll take on that lame challenge.<br>I want to see the face of that god of yours.

Occur_String2=So I can meet your gods when I reach the top of the tower?<br>Rugard... Bulcan... Those gods?
Occur_String3=Of course. We priests are passing on the divine revelation of the gods...<br>Those who reach the top of the tower will be able to have an audience with the gods.
Occur_String4=A divine revelation, huh... So I have to risk my life for that?<br>And, I don't like your gods...
Occur_String5=The tower was built by the two gods in order to let their creations fight...<br>The tower reflects the one who you fear the most. You must fight the enemy within you and risk your life. <br>But if you climb the tower and meet the gods, you will be able to tell them your grievances.
Occur_String6=You think I'm just going to tell them my grievances? I don't like them, so I'll have to beat them up.
Occur_String7=All the living creatures on the Mu Continent are the creations of the gods.<br>You are saying that you will hit your parents... How irrational.<br>Even if you are a knight, power is not the most valuable thing in this world.
Occur_String8=I don't even know if I belong here, and I have no memory of the past.<br>In my current situation, they deserve a good beating.
Occur_String9=Phew... The gods have told us to not stop anyone from climbing the tower, regardless of what they think.<br>If you want to prove your thoughts, you will have to climb the tower.
Occur_String10=Of course. I'll go beat them up.
Doing_String=The giant tower built with the god's power...<br>Are the gods really at the top? Does this lead to the heavens...?

Occur_String2=What is it?
Occur_String3=I am Lammud, a researcher studying the Endless Tower.<br>The powerful monsters inside...<br>And the tower's incredible scale that cannot be explained by current technologies...
Occur_String4=God's power may be the only answer, but I am trying to analyze this tower scientifically.<br>If we can understand even a fraction of the technology that was used to build the tower, we would gain so much knowledge.<br>But those priests of the Endless Tower consider it impious and won't cooperate...
Occur_String5=A clash between religion and science, huh?
Occur_String6=I could really use your help.<br>Could you bring back the Tower Fragments found inside the Endless Tower?<br>You'll be able to get them after defeating powerful monsters.
Occur_String7=Okay. I was about to go in anyway...<br>It's no trouble.

Occur_String3=Phew... If only I could go in myself and do some research...<br>How the tower is activated... and what happens when I climb the tower...<br>There are so many things I'm curious about, but the monsters won't wait for me while I do the research.

Occur_String3=Understand the tower and myself? What do you mean?

Occur_String2=Really? It just looks like a big tower...
Occur_String3=No! You can't just think of it as a building.<br>If a tower can truly think, there must be some principles that make it act that way.
Occur_String4=I'm excited to find out its great secrets!<br>I want to know more about the monsters inside the Endless Tower this time.
Occur_String5=I think the monsters inside the tower move according to what the tower orders them to do.<br>They move systematically... and respond based on their enemy's strength. If we can find that system...!

Occur_String2=It looks like they are going to have a ritual for revival. Anilata's revival, of course.<br>And they are asking for cooperation with the ritual...
Occur_String3=Especially, this... Dullahan. Doesn't it sound like a name?<br>If you ever meet an enemy named Dullahan inside the Blood Castle, don't let him pass!<br>We might find a clue.
Occur_String4=Dullahan... Okay. That name sounds somewhat disturbing. I'll look for him.
Occur_String5=And having a ritual to revive someone reminds me of them...
Doing_String=Dullahan... cooperation...<br>The Crusaders must have conspired with some outside force.<br>Who would possibly work with them...?
Completable_String1=You really met Dullahan?<br>And that's...? Secret orders?<br>Please give it to me! I'll take a close look.

Occur_String3=Dullahan is an alliance commander deployed from Pandemonium.<br>It looks like the Pandemonium forces are able to rapidly restore Anilata's soul.
Occur_String4=Now that Anilata has teamed up with Pandemonium, the full recovery of Anilata<br>will throw this world into an unprecedented state of chaos.
Occur_String5=But I wonder what kind of magic or technique of Pandemonium is making Anilata resurrect sooner...<br>Have you seen anything strange inside the Blood Castle?
Occur_String6=I did see something out of place.<br>A coffin made out of crystals.<br>It looks like Anilata was inside that coffin.
Occur_String7=The Crystal Coffin! I heard that some lights shoot up from the Blood Castle sometimes.<br>If those lights come from the Crystal Coffin, and it has to do with Anilata's resurrection...
Occur_String8=Please find some clues from the Crystal Coffin.<br>We must find out exactly what the Crystal Coffin is!

Occur_String2=That crystal indiscriminately absorbs all energy from around.<br>Even life forces and souls.<br>If one is exposed to this Pandemonium crystal for long, they might grow weak and even die.
Occur_String3=The Crystal Coffin was transferring the energy obtained like that to Anilata.<br>Anilata... is trying to resurrect by sacrificing his own Crusaders.<br>And that by using the power of Pandemonium!
Occur_String4=Anilata... I heard he used to be the defender of Akneria. He's the type I hate.<br>Those who use their followers for what they want...
Occur_String5=Knight! Anilata shouldn't have resurrected completely yet.<br>This is our chance to stop him!<br>Please defeat Anilata in the Blood Castle!
Doing_String=Rugard! Please give us the courage to defeat Anilata!
Completable_String1=You are amazing, Knight. You defeated Anilata!<br>You are the disciple of hope that Rugard has sent us!
Completable_String2=But as mere creations, we have no way of eliminating Anilata.<br>We... can only put him in a deep sleep.<br>But if we don't do that... Then we'll all be doomed.<br>This war just got started, and it will continue on.

Occur_String2=You're saying you discovered that mine?
Occur_String3=Huh? I didn't tell you anything... and you already figured it out?<br>Ah... Yeah. I must be the one who found the mine! Because I look great at a glance...<br>You have better sense that I thought.
Occur_String4=Anyway, I found the Magic Gem Mine...<br>And I opened up the Rift to the Mine...<br>Shouldn't you be helping me in return, if you have any conscience at all?
Occur_String5=W-wait. How did you come to that conclusion?
Occur_String6=There are spiders and skeletons that get in the way of mining the Magic Gems.<br>They look like they were affected by the Magic Gems, and seem like they'll be hard to defeat...
Occur_String7=I need you to defeat those monsters... But doing just that would be boring, right?<br>Bring me the corpses of those spiders and skeletons. I have to find out something.<br>Hm. Saying corpses of skeletons sounds strange. Let's say Skeleton Fragments.
Occur_String8=Anyway, bring me that, and I'll allow you go inside the Magic Gem Mine.<br>Sounds like a good deal, right? I think I'm losing in this deal.<br>Anyway, you don't have to if you don't want to.

Completable_String1=What took you so long? Did you breed the monsters before killing them?<br>Good thing you made it out alive at least.

Occur_String5=Rift controller? What will you do with that?
Occur_String6=You saw it in the Magic Gem Mine!<br>It's a machine that creates an artificial Rift!
Occur_String7=To create a Rift, you need to save up loads of Rift Warps and then... Boom! You make it explode.<br>The problem is that Rifts created like that are unstable. I'm trying to make them stable.

Doing_String=Hurry! It seems like something might really happen if we let them be!

Doing_String=Peekaboo. My Katherine, Demian, Elizabeth. You're back with mommy. I'll let you go back to your friends again soon.
Completable_String1=Good, very good. We will only see Goblins in fairytales from now on.<br>I will make it happen!<br>And I have to look for new guards for my vault!
Complete_String=I cleaned up Luery's Secret Vault The Goblins will no longer appear there. But as long as her greed remains the same, this kind of commotion will occur again. I just hope I won't be around when that happens.

Occur_String2=I'll get going...
Occur_String3=Wait! A! Minute!<br>It would be better if it had a little more magic. It's lacking just a little.
Occur_String4=You know a beautiful lady's skin is like a treasure, right?<br>Don't you want to protect it with all your life?
Occur_String5=Can you bring me more dewdrops? It would be great if it had a little more magic.<br>Thanks, Knight! I knew you wouldn't refuse a lady's request.

Occur_String4=If you are sorry, why would you send the mud to Mukler?
Occur_String5=That's one thing. And this is another.<br>Since he teased me, I will tease him too.<br>But I feel bad so I will work.

Occur_String3=I don't know. Why Mukler is happy. It's not how it should go.
Occur_String4=But compliments aren't bad.<br>Maybe Mukler is good.
Occur_String5=Mukler asked for more mud.<br>Get it for me. More mud than last time.
Occur_String6=Darn it. So I have to do all the dirty work.<br>Should I take the mud to Mukler then?
Occur_String7=...No.<br>Bring it to me. I'll give it to him.

[Quest_9500]
Name=Giant Clock
Occur_String1=Is this giant device next to you... a type of the Trenta?<br>It looks very different from what I've seen so far.<br>It looks... like a giant clock. I feel like I'm inside of it.
Occur_String2=This is a newly discovered rift.<br>It's a rift that created from an error of the Trenta's integrated circuit.<br>I have never seen a rift that heavily warped and mixed.
Occur_String3=The energy from this rift is so powerful that even the strongest warriors can't stay for long.<br>What's strange is that someone named Lupa left a message about it in there.
Occur_String4=The Rift Research Society named it Lupa's Labyrinth, and has been carefully researching this place.<br>As time passes and more adventurers go into the rift, many secrets have been revealed inside this giant labyrinth.
Occur_String5=But, Knight? Your eyes are already filled with wonder and curiosity...<br>I suppose it'll be hard to refuse your help.<br>Okay. I accept your help.
Occur_String6=What? I didn't make any expression...<br>My eyes have been always like this...
Occur_String7=Thank you.<br>I will prepare some stuff to help you explore the labyrinth.<br>Please hold on. I'll take out the item.

Completable_String1=Oh?!... Found it. <br>Here you go. You can use this fragment to create a powerful artifact.
Completable_String2=Artifacts are mysterious items found in the labyrinth.<br>Oh, right... You don't know about artifacts, do you?
Complete_String=Grande from the Rift Research Society gave me an artifact fragment. He said it's an item required to create artifacts. I couldn't really believe that this item would make me stronger.
List_String=I knew that the Rift Research Society does a lot of weird things, but I didn't know they were connected to such a dangerous space. I'll take Grande's item before I enter.
Mission_String=Receive an item from Grande
Mission_Target1=Talk to Grande

[Quest_9501]
Name=Mysterious Artifact
Occur_String1=There are various types of artifacts, and each artifact has unique characteristic and feature.<br>That's why each artifact requires different materials.
Occur_String2=The way to make artifacts is relatively easy compared to the amount of power you get.<br>You just need to select an artifact that you want to craft and collect required materials.<br>Once you equip the artifact, the power from the artifact will make you stronger.
Occur_String3=That's it? That's too easy... This gives me more power, really?
Occur_String4=It's easy to make.<br>But artifacts can grow like people do.<br>If you want more power, you have to make the artifact grow.
Occur_String5=Even so... I can't believe this small fragment can have that much power.
Occur_String6=Oh, what I just gave you is a starter from the Rift Research Society. You can only make artifacts like the Growing Sprout.<br>It only has about one tenth of the power that a real artifact has.
Occur_String7=But it will be useful until you get used to artifacts and the labyrinth.<br>You will have to find the materials to create a real artifact later on.<br>I myself rarely have seen real artifacts, and only a handful artifacts had been improved.
Occur_String8=Well, how about making an artifact now?<br>First, try to make it by yourself.<br>If you are not sure how to do it, let me know. Then, I'll tell you in more detail.
Doing_String=Press the [J] key for crafting an Artifact, or select the [Craft] tab from the [Artifacts] window.<br>Then, select the artifact you want and craft it.<br>Keep in mind that you need materials to craft an artifact.
Completable_String1=Let me see the artifact you crafted. Hm... It's good. Great.<br>Then, I'll tell you how to grow and equip artifacts.<br>It's not hard either. But it requires your effort.
Completable_String2=First, select the artifact you want to grow and clear Lupa's Labyrinth.<br>The artifact will absorb the energy from Lupa's Labyrinth and grow.<br>It's similar to equip it. Select the artifact you want to equip and its power will help you.
Complete_String=I crafted an artifact and also heard how to grow and equip it. But I'm still not fully convinced. Will this really make me stronger that easily?
List_String=Grande told me to craft an artifact. I'll try to craft it myself and ask her again if I can't do it by myself.
Mission_String=Craft the Growing Sprout Artifact
Mission_Target1=Craft an artifact

[Quest_9512]
Name=Hyre and Ross
Occur_String1=Now that you have the artifact, you should go into the labyrinth.
Occur_String2=Hyre and Ross over there might look young, but they are very talented researchers who've explored the labyrinth.<br>They will guide you inside the labyrinth.
Doing_String=
Completable_String1=Welcome, Knight. Nice to meet you.<br>I'm Hyre. And this one is Ross.<br>...<br>Ross? You should say hi.
Completable_String2=Hi. I'm Ross...

Completable_String4=Ah...! Alright!<br>Hello... Nice to... meet you. My name is... Ross.
Complete_String=I got to meet Hyre and Ross. Hyre seems to be nice and cheerful... and Ross reminds me of Mukler. At least he seems to listen to Hyre.

Mission_String=Talk to Hyre
Mission_Target1=Talk to Hyre

[Quest_9502]
Name=Not Worth the Breath
Occur_String1=Sir, if it's the first time you are going... you must equip your artifact...
Occur_String2=Just speak casually. I can't stand it.
Occur_String3=Really? That sounds good to me.<br>Glad that we speak the same language.<br>Hyre is too formal.
Occur_String4=Then... first! Go take a look around the labyrinth and come back.<br>If you just die as soon as you go in or get scared and don't want to go in after I tell you everything, I'll end up wasting my breath right?<br>I'll explain when you come back.
Occur_String5=If you want more information, prove that you are someone who can get through the labyrinth first.
Doing_String=Tsk... That Mukler. He forbid anyone from going further because it's dangerous.<br>There's no one who knows more about the labyrinth than me...
Completable_String1=Ooh, you came back alive. Then you are worthy of the explanation.<br>I'm sure you figured it out already, but that place is connected to various spaces.<br>You can't tell where you are, or what's in which place.<br>If you just advance, you won't reach the end. It's a labyrinth after all.
Completable_String2=Of course research is what matters to us, but you must be wondering what you'll gain?<br>You can obtain artifacts and grow them inside the labyrinth.<br>I know you heard about artifacts from Grande, so I'll skip that…<br>You get a special energy when you defeat Rift Predators. And that energy is what grows artifacts.
Completable_String3=Lastly, we have created a special device in this special place.<br>It's called the Spring and it lets you adjust the level of the labyrinth.<br>The more you wind up the spring, the more the rift is warped.<br>It gets more dangerous, but your reward will be greater as well. So always check the Spring. I can't and won't be responsible for what happens.
Complete_String=I went to the labyrinth like Ross said... it was a mysterious and incomprehensible place.
List_String=I must go to the labyrinth like Ross said. The only issue is that Ross talks like Mukler and I don't really like it.
Mission_String=Clear the Labyrinth 1 time
Mission_Target1=Clear the Labyrinth

[Quest_9503]
Name=Labyrinth's Special Threat 1
Occur_String1=Since you've been in the labyrinth... didn't you see a monster with a special power there?<br>A monster that increases the attack power of other monsters, or something like that.
Occur_String2=Now that you say it, I might have seen it. Troublesome.
Occur_String3=We call that kind of power Aura.<br>So they are Aura monsters. Leave their lame name...
Occur_String4=Anyway, I'm researching those Aura monsters' power.<br>You know what I mean, right?
Occur_String5=So what kind of Aura do I need to bring?
Occur_String6=Hm. Good that you are straightforward.<br>I need the Swamp Ghost, Sacrifice, and Mana Burn types. Those three types.<br>There are a few more, but those three are the most urgent.<br>Please defeat the monsters with that type of Aura and collect the Aura energy.
Doing_String=What? Forget them already? I'll say it once again. Listen carefully.<br>I need the Swamp Ghost, Sacrifice, and Mana Burn types. Those three types.
Completable_String1=Alright. This should be enough.<br>I need to sort these out, so come back later.<br>I have another favor. But if you die before that, I guess it can't be helped.
Complete_String=I brought the Swamp Ghost, Sacrifice, and Mana Burn Aura types from the labyrinth for Ross. But, listening to him talk... I would have punched him if it wasn't for Hyre.

Name=High-density Labyrinth
Occur_String1=Knight, Knight! Can you please do me a favor too?
Occur_String2=If the reward is acceptable, and if it's something that I can do.
Occur_String3=We'll have a good reward prepared, and you should be able to do it easily.
Occur_String4=You heard about the Spring, right? In short, it's a device that lets us create a more heavily warped rift.<br>The more it's warped, the higher the level of the labyrinth, and the more dangerous it is. It also means that we can gather data faster from the labyrinth.<br>And you can aim for better rewards.
Occur_String5=So my request is for you to explore the labyrinth level 5 or higher.<br>And tell me what your impression was and what kind of place it was after you explore the higher levels of labyrinth.
Occur_String6=That's simple. I don't even need to bring anything back.<br>I'll be back.
Doing_String=I'm not suspecting your skills, but the labyrinth isn't that easy.<br>Please be careful.
Completable_String1=You are back. Are you hurt anywhere?<br>How was the labyrinth at that level? Do you feel nauseous, or have a headache or ringing ears... or anything?
Complete_String=I carried out Hyre's request. I heard that staying in the rift for too long can cause mutations, but I feel fine even after several visits to that powerful labyrinth. I can't help but wonder about who I am.

Occur_String3=Of course... it's closer to the former. So calm down.
Occur_String4=I need more types of Auras. All the Auras have different characteristics and texture.<br>Well, that's why they have different effects.
Occur_String5=This time I need four types, Skin, Black Hole, Fiery Crash, and Recovery.<br>How you obtain them is same as last time. You know right?
Doing_String=This is an official request from the Rift Research Society. We won't rip you off with the rewards or anything, so don't worry!
Completable_String1=You got them all this time as well. Here's your reward. You may go now.<br>I have to research these, so we won't be seeing each other for a while.<br>Don't get killed.
Complete_String=I brought the Skin, Black Hole, Fiery Crash, and Recovery Aura types from the labyrinth for Ross. Regardless of the request, I would have beat him up if my brother was a brat like him.

Occur_String2=It's a mysterious place, but it isn't too hard.<br>Oh, and I'm using the artifact I made with the fragment you gave me before.
Occur_String3=Is that so? I was about to ask you for a favor regarding the artifact fragments.
Occur_String4=You've been a great help, but we always need more adventurers who can help our research.<br>We can use artifact fragments to recruit more adventurers.<br>Just like we gave you one.
Occur_String5=...I knew you would understand. Thank you.<br>You'll get a god reward, so don't worry.
Occur_String6=Well, no... Sigh... Okay. I'll bring some.<br>But I also need artifact fragments, you know?
Occur_String7=Then, could you clean up the labyrinth so that I can collect fragments too?<br>If you can do that, I'll get the fragments myself.
Occur_String8=It would be great if it was a higher level. Maybe... level 10?<br>If you can clean up that level, I should be able to collect fragments.
Doing_String=How can I collect them?<br>Hehe. That's my business secret.
Completable_String1=Thank you, Knight. I was able to collect a lot of fragments.<br>I'll use them well.
Completable_String2=Hm... I can't tell you how I collect the fragments.<br>You are so persistent, Knight.
Complete_String=I cleared the labyrinth so that Grande could collect fragments. But no matter how hard I think about it, I still don't understand how Grande was able to collect fragments.
List_String=Grande said that if I clear Lupa's Labyrinth (level 10), she will collect the artifact fragments on her own. I got one from her before, so I need to help her.

Name=Like Raising a Kid
Occur_String1=Knight, are your artifacts growing well?<br>You know how to grow them, right?<br>You can get energy to grow your artifacts when you defeat Rift Predators.
Occur_String2=If you have an artifact of level 10 or above, can you show it to me?<br>I've researched the rift for a long time, but high level artifacts are hard to come by.<br>Please.
Doing_String=One can never forget the brilliance of a powerful artifact.
Completable_String1=Wow! This gorgeous look and sparkle.<br>Ahh... I would love to have one of these some day.
Complete_String=I showed Grande a well-grown artifact and she stared at it blankly. It looks like she really wants one... but unfortunately she doesn't seem to have the power to grow an artifact.

Name=Cry of the Rift Predator
Occur_String1=Have you met a Rift Predator inside the labyrinth?<br>Well, your artifact has leveled up and you are still alive. That means you've defeated the Rift Predators.
Occur_String2=We are still trying to find out who they are,<br>and the reason behind their outcry, but we still know almost nothing about them.
Occur_String3=Some Rift Predators look like people... I mean...<br>Some of them are like us.
Occur_String4=Yes. That's why I'm more concerned about them, but there's no way to reverse their mutation.<br>The only thing we can do is to continue our research in order to prevent other people who enter the rift from mutating as well.
Occur_String5=That's why we are very lucky to have talented people like you, Knight.<br>Since now we can explore the labyrinth at higher levels that have been too dangerous for us.
Occur_String6=Do you think you can clear level 15?<br>Please defeat the Rift Predators there and collect their Essences.
Doing_String=Do you think the Rift Predators are knights and warriors from another rifts?<br>Maybe, they all went in for their own reasons and got stuck there for ages.<br>And that's how their bodies were mutated and their minds gave in, making them cry out like that...
Completable_String1=Thank you. I'll take care of the Essences you brought.<br>I will produce meaningful outcomes. No matter what.
Complete_String=I brought the Rift Predator's Essences that Hyre asked for. If they are really people from other rifts like Hyre said... I could say that I gave them eternal peace.

Name=Measuring the Max
Occur_String1=Where do you think is the end of the labyrinth?
Occur_String2=Well... inside the labyrinth, it's hard to tell where I am.<br>The endpoint of something is also a space-based concept, isn't it?<br>Since I can't tell my location, there's no way of knowing anything else.
Occur_String3=Oh, Knight. You are philosophical.<br>As expected, you aren't just all muscles.
Occur_String4=The Rift Research Society controls the level of the labyrinth with the Spring.<br>Our standard is a warrior who can clear level 20 or higher.<br>We believe that if one can meet that standard, they have a potential to reach the end of the labyrinth.
Occur_String5=What do you say? Would you like to challenge it?<br>It will be a good chance to see if you are someone who can reach the end.
Occur_String6=I'm a knight... so I can't help but feel intrigued when I hear that.<br>I accept the challenge.
Doing_String=Even if this is a gamble... I'll bet on you!<br>Good luck!
Completable_String1=You really are amazing!<br>I've never seen someone like you during the whole time I've been in charge of Lupa's Labyrinth with the Rift Research Society!
Complete_String=I completed Hyre's suggestion successfully. It was a dangerous and difficult task, but it was also thrilling to have left my mark in Lupa's Labyrinth.

Occur_String1=Knight! Did you know that there's a limit to artifact growth?<br>I heard from Grande that its limit is level 20.
Occur_String2=Ah... I want to see one!<br>Grande said that a level 20 artifact is so rare that even she had only seen it twice.
Occur_String3=So... if your artifact reached the max level, could you show it to me?
Doing_String=A level 20 artifact... I can't even imagine what it's like!
Completable_String1=Here, the artifact. Look at it all you want.
Completable_String2=Oh! Oh! This is it! How can it be so beautiful and elaborate!!!
Complete_String=I showed Hyre the max level artifact, who went crazy over it. Am I weird for not recognizing its beauty? If I ever find out who I am and achieve peace, it would be nice to teach myself to see the beauty of things.

Name=Artifact Alchemy
Occur_String1=I heard from Hyre, Knight.<br>I heard you maxed out your artifact?
Occur_String2=Why? Do you want to see it too? It doesn't cost me a thing to show you.<br>Here. Look at it all you want.
Occur_String3=…
Occur_String4=Oh, gods! Knight! Can you tell how precious this is?<br>This brilliant look! Imbued with the power of the rift! The aggregation of all magic and skills!<br>If I could sell this, I would be able to buy a whole village!<br>It's amazing! Just so amazing!
Occur_String5=H-hey... got it. Got it. Stop... Stop shaking me.<br>I'm getting dizzy.
Occur_String6=Oh, my... Hmm. Sorry. I was...<br>That's not what I wanted to say, but since you showed me the artifact... Hmm.
Occur_String7=Take your max level artifact to the Alchemist Merchant in Ohrdor.<br>He will cast alchemy on the artifact.<br>I don't know how he does it, but he can craft very rare items through artifact alchemy.
Occur_String8=However, the Growing Sprout is just an imitation made by the Rift Research Society,<br>so you won't get an item as good as if you were to use a real artifact.<br>So don't have high expectations when you get artifact alchemy on the Growing Sprout.
Occur_String9=Also!!<br>You have to keep this in mind.<br>The artifact used as a material for artifact alchemy will disappear!<br>So make sure you try artifact alchemy when you have an extra artifact.
Doing_String=Artifact alchemy is good... but it's unfortunate that such a beautiful artifact will disappear.
Completable_String1=Grande from the Rift Research Society told me to find you for artifact alchemy.<br>But... haven't we met before? You look familiar.
Completable_String2=Oh, another customer. Unfortunately, we have never met before.<br>And is that important? Artifact alchemy is what matters.<br>I'll explain, so listen well. And don't get mad at me when your artifact is gone.
Completable_String3=Melting a max level artifact to create something new. That's artifact alchemy.<br>The artifact disappears since I need to melt it first... I don't know what's going to come out at the end.<br>Since no one knows what the energy from the artifact will do with alchemy.<br>I have heard of those who got something very precious from artifact alchemy, and boasted about it.
Completable_String4=If you want to try it, give me your artifact. I'll cast the alchemy for you.<br>But I would suggest you use an artifact that you don't need.<br>Since you'll be in a pinch once the artifact disappears.<br>I won't stop you from using any artifact, but think carefully.
Complete_String=I heard about artifact alchemy from the Alchemist Merchant. To create something new with a max level artifact... it sounds interesting, but the artifact will disappear, so I have to be careful.
List_String=I must go find the Alchemist Merchant in Ohrdor and ask about artifact alchemy.

Completable_String1=Hello, Knight. Welcome to Lupa's Labyrinth.
Complete_String=I met Grande in front of Lupa's Labyrinth. Next to her, I saw a rift surrounded by the most complex machine I have ever seen. I could only gape at it for a while.

Completable_String1=I picked up a strange jewel in Lupa's Labyrinth…<br>When I touched it, I got teleported into a giant library.<br>Do you know anything about such a phenomenon or stuff? It looked like a rift as well.
Completable_String2=What? Is there something like that? I-I've never heard that before...<br>D-do you have that jewel?
Completable_String3=No. The jewel disappeared.

Completable_String1=Do you know about a strange jewel that teleports you to a giant library?<br>Sigh... I know it sounds absurd.
Completable_String2=Hm? You've been there? Oh. You are very lucky.<br>That's not an easy place to access. You had a valuable experience.
Completable_String3=So you know about it.<br>What's that place?
Completable_String4=It's just one of many rifts.<br>The strange jewel you mentioned... I call it the Porystal.<br>Anyway, it's different from other rifts that you can only enter with the jewel.
Completable_String5=It must be a rift that someone created while studying the rift across the universe.<br>And the Porystal must be a key to the library.<br>You know, in the Room of Duty? I heard someone had made a rift into their vault. Books are nothing.
Complete_String=The Alchemist Merchant seems to know about the jewel he calls the Porystal and the library... but he doesn't look like he wants to tell me about it.

Occur_String4=I'm a genius who uses his head, not his body, you see. My brain will make great contributions to the entire Mu Continent, so it cannot get hurt. And, I have nothing to tell you about how dangerous this guy is. I ran away as soon as I felt a threat.
Occur_String5=How did you know he was dangerous?
Occur_String6=He's not like the watchmen in other rifts. I felt a very ominous energy. It was oddly familiar, but very unpleasant. And he looked totally different from the watchmen so far. He just looked dangerous.

That's why monsters are coming out from that rift.

Occur_String4=Was the machine that you destroyed a weapon? That's just an excavator! <br>We excavated the cave with it to get to the root of the World Tree.
Occur_String5=We just wanted to destroy the roots that condense the energy of the Earth and stopped the World Tree's wave!

Occur_String4=Hm... Never mind. Did the Ashas tell you to do that?

Occur_String4=Calm down.<br>It's true that we are physically and culturally behind the Ashas...<br>But we've been able to protect our country thanks to our telepathic ability.
