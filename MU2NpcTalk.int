[Quest_5001]
StartQuest1=The Demons have resurfaced for the first time in two hundred years...
StartQuest2=Why?
GreetingQuest1=I can't identify this energy...
GreetingQuest2=I should report this to Leo.

[Quest_5002]
StartQuest1=Is she an elf?
GreetingQuest1=I can't destroy it.
GreetingQuest2=Maybe it can't be destroyed by physical force alone.

[Quest_5003]
StartQuest1=I didn't know the pathway that connects Pandemonium to this realm was so powerful.

[Quest_5004]
StartQuest1=Rarbas have entered the tunnel at last. This is my fault.
StartQuest2=I didn't get rid of all the explosives in the Amberial Forest.
CompleteQuest1=Duprian, he's a natural leader.

[Quest_5005]
StartQuest1=He was sealed away after the Three Year War. It's going to be a tough battle.
Mission2_1=What's this? Did it belong to Glasha?

[Quest_5007]
StartQuest1=
StartQuest2=

[Quest_5008]
StartQuest1=Through Evil Energy, like they did in Enova.
StartQuest2=Bredrice Plains must be in shambles by now.

[Quest_5009]
StartQuest1=If this holy water purges the Dark Reaper, then it proves I'm no member of the Mission.
StartQuest2=This'll be Zakarian's penultimate test. If I pass, I'll be able to remember everything!

StartQuest2=What does the Lorencia Royal Army do?
Mission1_1=These spiders are also mutating rapidly.
Mission1_2=
Mission2_1=Now that I've destroyed their eggs, at least their number shouldn't increase for a while.

[//Quest_13]
StartQuest1=Please be careful, Royce.
StartQuest2=As I thought, Dudrin is a dominion of the Lorencia Kingdom.

[Quest_13]
Mission1_1=Mutants threaten the peace of Dudrin, and yet the Lorencia Kingdom Army wants spider legs.
Mission1_2=The Lorencia Kingdom Army... Are they out of their minds?

[//Quest_14]
Mission1_1=Get yourself together and return to Lorencia...!

[Quest_15]
Mission1_1=Shama's intestines... Can they really be used as medicine?

[Quest_24]
StartQuest1=They've set up explosives above the tunnel connected to Dudrin.
StartQuest2=They're planning to invade Dudrin through the tunnel.

[Quest_33]
StartQuest1=I've gotten myself into a war that has nothing to do with me.

[Quest_16]
StartQuest1=So these people believe in a god named Rugard...
StartQuest2=Why isn't Rugard intervening in this situation already?

[Quest_18]
StartQuest1=The Humans, Dwarves, and Elves comprise the Heraus Coalition.
StartQuest2=I wonder what races are in the opposing Line Alliance.

[Quest_19]
Mission1_1=Evil Energy even affects plants.

[Quest_21]
StartQuest1=Royce... Where the hell is it?

[Quest_23]
StartQuest1=Rarbas... What are they up to?
Mission1_1=What's this? It looks like a component of something.

[Quest_28]
StartQuest1=There are detonators. I can stop the explosion if I hurry.
Mission1_1=Phew, I think I've disarmed them all.

[Quest_32]
StartQuest1=On, no! It's not Dudrin they're after!
Mission1_1=No time to lose – got to alert the Weiss Basin that their mine's in danger.

[Quest_29]
StartQuest1=The mine is Dudrin's main source of income. Without it, the city won't survive.
StartQuest2=Those Pandemonium lowlifes are stronger than I thought.

[Quest_30]
StartQuest1=I can't believe the Dwarves have a degenerate like that as their leader.

[Quest_35]
StartQuest1=He's going to run. I've misjudged him.

[Quest_102]
StartQuest1=Time's short, but I'd better rescue the miners here first.
Mission1_1=They can't hurt the miners anymore.

[Quest_103]
Mission2_1=This should be enough to put out the fire.

[Quest_104]
Mission1_1=Phew, it's finally been put out.

[Quest_105]
StartQuest1=In the meantime, I'll scatter the Keru Legion before it gets close to the center of the basin.
StartQuest2=The enemy has enough soldiers to isolate the Weiss Basin.

[Quest_108]
StartQuest1=Linda... I can't stop worrying about her.
Mission1_1=There's no trace of Linda anywhere.

[Quest_135]
StartQuest1=It's too late. Now we'll just have to ambush them.
Mission1_1=It's too late. They've already finished building their base.
Mission1_2=I'll have to go to the Karmatan Mine and join Duprian.

[Quest_136]
StartQuest1=I can't believe she risked her life to come and see me.

[Quest_137]
StartQuest1=I don't know if I can live up to their expectations...

[Quest_111]
StartQuest1=They've reunited with the Pandemonium Army. Are they planning to hit the Karmatan Mine?
Mission1_1=These severed heads will prove that the Goblins participated in the war.

[Quest_112]
StartQuest1=I'll show you what hell looks like, filthy goblins!
Mission1_1=You're homeless now.
Mission2_1=This is the price you pay for siding with Pandemonium again.
Mission3_1=There are too few soldiers. Something seems off.

[Quest_113]
StartQuest1=If I can find their battle plan, I'll know what they're up to.

[//Quest_113]
Mission1_1=They've split it into three pieces.

[Quest_115]
StartQuest1=This is ridiculous…

[Quest_116]
StartQuest1=On, no! If Duprian falls, Dudrin will follow!
Mission1_1=This is for trying to kill Duprian.
Mission1_2=I'm going to the Karmatan Mine. I have to meet Duprian.

[Quest_118]
StartQuest1=They're surrounding the mine—why haven't they attacked yet?
Mission1_1=There's nothing here, except those strange-looking statues.

[Quest_120]
StartQuest1=Royce might know why they want to isolate Karmatan.
Mission1_1=This should have bought Duprian enough time to escape.

[Quest_121]
StartQuest1=Karmatan wasn't their target. Duprian was.
Mission1_1=Civilians...! Those brutes killed any who resisted.
Mission2_1=Bah, I can't find any clues.

[Quest_131]
StartQuest1=Were they sealed in with their master?
Mission1_1=Whoah! Glasha's lieutenants were just as tough as their master.

[Quest_138]
StartQuest1=They're a major player in Dudrin. They should know about the wagons.

[Quest_124]
StartQuest1=This has something to do with the wagons that took those civilians.
StartQuest2=Why did they steal the mine blueprint?
Mission1_1=This must be the blueprint.

[Quest_126]
StartQuest1=Their ultimate target was the Heath Mine! But why?!
Mission1_1=The Mining Association President and I are now even.
Mission1_2=The Eastern Post oversees the Heath Mine.

[Quest_128]
StartQuest1=Why did they drag the miners to the death pit? Better search for some clues.
Mission1_1=What's this? Looks important.

[Quest_201]
StartQuest1=Is this the place? Can regain my memory here?

[Quest_202]
StartQuest1=Duprian... I miss that name.

[Quest_207]
StartQuest1=Those Pandemonium scoundrels haven't given up on invading this realm yet.
StartQuest2=A journey to another continent.

[Quest_203]
StartQuest1=Kundun Mephis, the ruler of the Media Kingdom and one of the great sages...
StartQuest2=Can he help me regain my memory? I hope so...

[Quest_301]
StartQuest1=So they're not just ordinary farmhouses...
StartQuest2=Anyway, I'd better help the workers evacuate.

[Quest_311]
StartQuest1=A large-scale invasion. This is war.
StartQuest2=I need to buy time to let the farm workers evacuate.
Mission1_1=Why're they using stone throwers to attack the plains?

[Quest_312]
StartQuest1=Maybe I should ask someone in the army for help with the evacuation.
Mission1_1=The Evil Energy is mutating the creatures around here.

[Quest_314]
StartQuest1=So, this is Zakarian's first test to help me regain my memory...
StartQuest2=I need to find Pandemonium Army Commander Sezak.
Mission1_1=I've found Sezak's orders.

[Quest_315]
StartQuest1=Dumpain... Mayor of Ohrdor...
StartQuest2=Why did he send the army to the Black Farm?

[Quest_332]
StartQuest1=Sezak is in the vestibule. Vestibule...
StartQuest2=Time to stop this legion of Gnolls that have descended upon the Central Base.

[Quest_318]
StartQuest1=Those damned Kobolds poisoned the grain!
StartQuest2=Got to find the abandoned poison extractors.
Mission1_1=Is this a deadly poison extractor?

[Quest_320]
StartQuest1=Use an extractor to get some of the poison,
StartQuest2=and the Ohrdor Lab can formulate an antidote with it.
Mission1_1=What's this mark for?!

[Quest_333]
CompleteQuest1=Fool me again, and you won't live to see another day.

[Quest_322]
StartQuest1=She doesn't know where the vestibule is.
StartQuest2=I'd better stop the smoke signal first.
Mission1_1=Phew, I stopped the smoke signal before the Kobold Legion could see it.

[Quest_324]
StartQuest1=Like the cursed rat that he is, he's hiding in his lackey's hangout.
StartQuest2=Zakarian's second test is to get rid of him.Wait for me, Sezak.
Mission1_1=Bah, Sezak isn't here anymore.

[Quest_329]
CompleteQuest1=I finished off the queen. They won't be attacking the farms anytime soon.

[Quest_330]
StartQuest1=If Sezak recognizes me, then I'm a puppet of Pandemonium.
StartQuest2=I won't know until I meet him.
Mission1_1=Losing the leaders of the Gnoll Legion will cripple Sezak.

[Quest_331]
StartQuest1=The vestibule—it's the cave that generates the Evil Energy!
StartQuest2=Wait for me, Sezak. Please gods, don't let him recognize me...

[Quest_403]
Mission1_1=The corpses have been branded with strange marks.

[Quest_406]
Mission1_1=Is that a civilian campsite?

[Quest_412]
Mission1_1=May this holy water grant you peace...

[Quest_416]
StartQuest1=Lenavis, the last queen of Karol, who was slain unjustly...
StartQuest2=I must stop her resurrection ritual!
Mission1_1=Phew, I stopped the ritual just in time.
Mission1_2=Lunedill will be happy to see me back, for the first time in forever!

[Quest_425]
StartQuest1=Have I awakened the ghosts of the Karol Knights?
StartQuest2=Zakarian played me! Why?!

[Quest_409]
StartQuest1=They're just roaming around. I don't get it—what business could those angry ghosts have there?
StartQuest2=There has to be some reason.
Mission1_1=The ghosts are screaming Madri.
Mission1_2=What does that mean?

[Quest_413]
StartQuest1=The mother of the dead Karol Knights...
StartQuest2=Who the hell is she?

[Quest_420]
Mission1_1=They killed Samuel's sister as well as female followers.
Mission1_2=Rest in peace...

[Quest_422]
StartQuest1=I pray the people of Karol and their queen will rest peacefully.

[Quest_426]
StartQuest1=Have I resurrected her?
StartQuest2=I'll send her back from whence she came.

[Quest_427]
StartQuest1=Salormis, the cradle of the Tephakin Principality.
StartQuest2=This'll be the final battle, and by the gods, it will be bloody!

[Quest_502]
StartQuest1=To stop the Tephakin Principality Army from losing...
StartQuest2=I'll light the streetlamps and show the world that Kernel City still stands.
Mission1_1=I pray that all Tephakinese see these lights, even from afar.

[Quest_509]
StartQuest1=Oh no! That titan could crush the entire Duelden Continent!
StartQuest2=I must cut off its black mana supply.
Mission1_1=It was absorbing black mana at a remarkable speed.
Mission1_2=Now I've stopped the titan's resurrection.

[Quest_511]
StartQuest1=Orman, wait for me!
StartQuest2=Maybe Flying Bugs will lead me to the campsite.
Mission1_1=That must be the place. There are shattered pieces of wings from a fallen titan.

[Quest_512]
Mission1_1=Bah, Orman isn't here anymore.
Mission1_2=What the... is that the entrance? That must be the excavation site.

[Quest_513]
StartQuest1=The Garudas have joined the Pandemonium Army.
StartQuest2=If the entire Alliance has joined the enemy, then we're doomed.
StartQuest3=I'd better check the Garuda messengers.
Mission1_1=I knew I'd find some important documents.
Mission1_2=I'll ask Icarus about them, he should be able to tell me what they're about.

[Quest_518]
StartQuest1=Right now, the Tephakin Principality Army must be fighting the main Garuda forces.
StartQuest2=Better take care of the Gnoll Legion at the rear.
Mission1_1=Now the Garudas have no one to back them up.
Mission1_2=Hm? Who's that?

[Quest_520]
StartQuest1=Orman must be in the Sky Temple, too.
StartQuest2=I must cut a path through the Garuda stragglers and join the Principality Army.
Mission1_1=This is what happens when you get in my way.

[Quest_526]
StartQuest1=Bull! Winning a war isn't worth losing thousands of lives!

[Quest_802]
StartQuest1=The Dios stop, and suddenly everyone turns against you.

[Quest_806]
StartQuest1=If all Kanturians were as peaceful as Estesia,
StartQuest2=they wouldn't have been attacked so viciously, with or without the Dios.
Mission1_1=The place is becoming as warm as Estesia's heart.

[Quest_808]
Mission1_1=This should be enough food.

[Quest_809]
StartQuest1=I'll give you a slow and painful death.
Mission1_1=You monsters! You killed innocent civilians!

[Quest_810]
StartQuest1=Doctor Marongo has a warm heart.
Mission1_1=It's subtle, but I can tell the temperature is rising.

[Quest_811]
StartQuest1=Cold Stones, shaped to perfection.

[Quest_901]
StartQuest1=Well, knights need to eat too.
Mission1_1=So their hounds have gone feral.

[Quest_903]
StartQuest1=A branch of the Lorencia army has set up shop in the Drapian territory.
StartQuest2=No wonder why the Coalition and the Alliance don't get along.

[Quest_905]
StartQuest1=I'll deal with the heavily armored soldiers first.

[Quest_908]
StartQuest1=They've also been killed by the revenants. Better let Hopkins know.

[Quest_909]
StartQuest1=He's so immature, I feel sorry for those poor Devias Guards who have to put up with him.

[Quest_911]
Mission1_1=Even the repeaters are affected by the revenants.

[Quest_913]
CompleteQuest1=I heard that there's a path to the Sanguine Highlands nearby...

[Quest_917]
StartQuest1=Phew, the Nobility Alliance sure is a tough nut to crack.
StartQuest2=Their commander is first on my kill list.
Mission1_1=They won't dare mess with Devias for a while.

[Quest_915]
StartQuest1=I don't know if they deserted their barracks to run for their lives, or to their deaths.

[Quest_1003]
StartQuest1=Chaisong would be happy if he knew I helped the Drapians.

[Quest_1006]
StartQuest1=I'd better repair the fences and cull these mutants.

[Quest_1008]
Mission1_1=I'm late... they were all executed.

[Quest_1009]
CompleteQuest1=This must be Blood Ice Peak, the land of death.

[Quest_1010]
StartQuest1=Darn, a scout! I'll get in trouble if I lose them.
StartQuest2=I better kill them before things spiral out of control!

[Quest_1012]
StartQuest1=What the... Oh no! They're absorbing blood from the ground to mutate themselves!

[Quest_1102]
StartQuest1=Those brutes even use animals to help fight their battles!
Mission1_1=They won't threaten the outpost anymore.

[Quest_1103]
StartQuest1=Ah, I forgot to ask their shoe sizes.
Mission1_1=I've got enough boots now.
Mission2_1=This should be enough to feed the army at least once.

[Quest_1107]
StartQuest1=His wife'll be devastated. I can't tell her... no way!

[Quest_1108]
StartQuest1=Mandrake roots. I'm an herbalist now.

[Quest_1109]
StartQuest1=These must be failed test subjects.
StartQuest2=They experimented even on people.

[Quest_1112]
StartQuest1=I hear something over there. Someone's crying.

[Quest_1113]
StartQuest1=Eagles are hard to catch...

[Quest_1104]
StartQuest1=These mutant spiders are worse than those I've seen in Enova.

[Quest_1110]
StartQuest1=Aha, finally we meet. Let's get this over with.

[Quest_1205]
StartQuest1=Where the hell did these ghosts come from? Do they have something to do with that pile of stones?
StartQuest2=My gut tells me I should slay them and destroy that pile.
MissionDeco2_1_1=I can't tear it down. It's not an ordinary pile of stones.

[Quest_1208]
StartQuest1=Are these the knights of Pandemonium? They're determined to isolate Dracanem.

[Quest_1211]
StartQuest1=Hmm, what can I find in this frozen land that's edible?

[Quest_1212]
StartQuest1=Frog Beasts... used to eat them a lot when I was in Enova.

[Quest_1303]
StartQuest1=Wow... Even flowers have been mutated.

[Quest_1304]
StartQuest1=What are these beasts? Gremlins' pets? They need to be put down.

[Quest_1308]
StartQuest1=Is he their leader? I'll deal with him before he hurts anyone else.

[Quest_1314]
CompleteQuest1=This should be enough to slow the proliferation.

[Quest_5101]
StartQuest1=So this crystal from Ormanhas created dragons...
StartQuest2=I should go to Kundun and get to the bottom of this.

[Quest_5103]
StartQuest1=I'm about to set foot in Line Alliance territory.
StartQuest2=Why are Heraus and Line so angry at each other?

[Quest_5104]
StartQuest1=Dragons have appeared...
StartQuest2=Neria's Tears also exist here.

[Quest_5105]
StartQuest1=They're closing in on Qwyinan.
Mission1_1=This should do.

[Quest_5106]
StartQuest1=They tried to build a defensive line across the plain.
StartQuest2=The dragons have come this far, which means...
StartQuest3=Their defense line has been penetrated. This doesn't bode well.

[Quest_5107]
StartQuest1=The Line Alliance worships Bulcan, the god of war.
StartQuest2=Could these flags blessed by Bulcan really increase the air temperature?
Mission1_1=The temperature's rising.
Mission1_2=Bulcan's blessing…
Mission1_3=I guess it works just like Rugard's holy water.

[Quest_5108]
StartQuest1=Kundun was right. the Mission has invaded Drapia.
StartQuest2=But what does the Mission intend to do with a frozen land such as this one?

[Quest_5109]
StartQuest1=What's the Dark Mission up to this time?
Mission1_1=I couldn't uncover their true purpose, no matter how much I looked.
Mission2_1=They're too weak. And there are more researchers than soldiers here.

[Quest_5110]
StartQuest1=Now I know what the Mission is up to.
StartQuest2=The Mission is collecting Tears to rain devastation upon all the states of the kingdom!
StartQuest3=And Dracans Knight Master Chaisong was in on this.

[Quest_5111]
StartQuest1=Chaisong must have bribed Chakua.
StartQuest2=He's trying to keep the Dracans Knights tied up here.
Mission1_1=This gold coin is from Drapia, just as I expected.

[Quest_5112]
StartQuest1=Chaisong ran off to the deployment camp. I'd better catch up with him.
StartQuest2=I'll just have to go through the Chakua encampment.
Mission1_1=Their security is tighter than I thought.
Mission2_1=So he was the commander.

[Quest_5113]
StartQuest1=Neria's Tears are in the Closed Waterway.
StartQuest2=Better hurry if I want to catch up with him.

[Quest_5114]
StartQuest1=I'm on his trail now. I must stop him before he gets to Neria's Tears.

[Quest_5117]
StartQuest1=I don't think they're trying to reanimate the dead like they were last time.

[Quest_5118]
StartQuest1=He's risked treason charges to lure the ringleader of the Mission here.
StartQuest2=Chaisong, he's no ordinary man.
StartQuest3=Phew, I pray the ringleader of the Mission took the bait.
Mission1_1=Where could Neria's Tears possibly be?

[Quest_5131]
StartQuest1=They're a highly advanced civilization, like Chaisong said.
StartQuest2=Why did the battle machines stop?
Mission1_1=Without their battle machines, they can't even keep wild animals at bay.

[Quest_5132]
StartQuest1=This isn't good. They rely on Dios for everything.

[Quest_5133]
StartQuest1=These repeaters supply Pectra to the entirety of Musai.
Mission1_1=Bah, the Dios aren't working.

[Quest_5134]
StartQuest1=They've been attacking from all sides since the Dios stopped.
StartQuest2=Maybe the chief can tell me more about their situation.
Mission1_1=This should be enough to keep a path open.

[Quest_5135]
StartQuest1=They've oppressed neighboring races with their superior strength.
StartQuest2=Is helping them really the right thing to do?
Mission1_1=They wouldn't dare attack First Town again.

[Quest_5136]
StartQuest1=The Drapia Kingdom wants Kanturu?
StartQuest2=I can't believe Chaisong would do such a thing, but I won't know the truth until I investigate it myself.

[Quest_5137]
StartQuest1=I knew it wasn't Drapia that invaded Kanturu.
StartQuest2=Is Datans trying to steal Pectra while the Dios are out of order?
Mission1_1=This is what you get for setting fire to Southern Town!
Mission2_1=Why did they abduct the Kanturian scientist?

[Quest_5138]
StartQuest1=Oh, I really hope the Dios turn back on this time.
Mission1_1=Bah, the Dios still aren't moving.

[Quest_5139]
StartQuest1=Things just keep getting worse and worse.
StartQuest2=I still haven't found Marongo, the abducted scientist...

[Quest_5140]
StartQuest1=The Kanturians stole this land from the Golems.
StartQuest2=Maybe this is karma.
Mission4_1=These are magnetic bombs, and there are enough here to do away with an entire state.
Mission4_2=They're not trying to stop Dio—they're trying to destroy Western Town!
MissionDeco4_1_1=I must have touched something I shouldn't.

[Quest_5141]
StartQuest1=Marongo—he stopped the Dios!

[Quest_5142]
StartQuest1=I'll just have to reset the reactor.
StartQuest2=The Dios must be activated, or else Musai will fall!
Mission1_1=An autonomous Dio is protecting the fusion reactor... This won't be easy...

[Quest_5146]
StartQuest1=What on earth happened while I was gone?

[Quest_5147]
StartQuest1=Datans, I'll never forgive you!

[Quest_5151]
StartQuest1=Does this mean the Lorencia Kingdom's own Devias Knights hired Woongpam?
StartQuest2=I've got only five days to stop Drapia from collapsing.

[Quest_5152]
StartQuest1=A Coalition army, in Line Alliance territory...
StartQuest2=It's amazing a war hasn't broken out yet.
Mission1_1=Is Devias really in league with Woongpam?

[Quest_5153]
StartQuest1=I don't think Devias Knight Master Muren is lying to me.
Mission1_1=Bah, these officers don't know anything useful.
Mission2_1=All this information is useless. Maybe the Nobility Alliance has nothing to do with it.

[Quest_5154]
StartQuest1=Who could possibly wipe out Devias scouts? Well, better go find out.
Mission1_1=They've even mobilized cannons. They're determined to keep the Devias members here.

[Quest_5156]
StartQuest1=The revenants killed everyone!
StartQuest2=I've got to stop them before they begin appearing everywhere.
StartQuest3=The Mission's doing just what they did in Karolsandria!

[Quest_5157]
StartQuest1=I must stop the revenants' ritual!
Mission1_1=The ritual's almost over.
Mission1_2=I don't know if I stopped their resurrection or not.

[Quest_5158]
StartQuest1=I'd better go back and tell Muren about the revenants
StartQuest2=and that their emperor might be among them.
Mission1_1=The Nobility Alliance has mobilized trebuchets, too. They're determined to keep the Deviases busy.

[Quest_5159]
StartQuest1=When the revenants come out of the royal tomb, it'll be only a matter of time before the entire continent is overrun with them.

[Quest_5160]
StartQuest1=That was reckless. No one could've survived that.
StartQuest2=That goddamned Mission!
Mission1_1=I think I've got enough drinking water now.

[Quest_5161]
StartQuest1=Phew, First it was Queen Lenavis, and now it's Emperor Zelos.
StartQuest2=I must appease the revenants before they come out of the tomb.
Mission1_1=Phew, he was tougher than Queen Lenavis.

[Quest_5162]
Mission1_1=It was a diversion, to protect whatever they're scheming at in Sanguine Highlands.

[//Quest_5162]
Mission1_2=What are they up to?

[Quest_5163]
StartQuest1=What if the Dark Mission has reached this far? Oh, no...
Mission1_1=They've been resurrected by black magic.
Mission1_2=I knew the Mission was behind this!
Mission3_1=Where the hell are the scouts?
Mission3_2=Should I check there?

[Quest_5171]
StartQuest1=These bears seem to be frozen, yet they still move.

[Quest_5172]
StartQuest1=This is their leader? Time to die!
Mission1_1=Those people... They look familiar.

[Quest_5173]
StartQuest1=Two hundred years ago, a bloody war was fought between Pandemonium and this realm,
StartQuest2=and the battlefield is still soaked in blood.
Mission1_1=Bah, the pentacle is restored, but it's not yet strong enough to absorb the blood.

[Quest_5174]
StartQuest1=It wasn't the Mission, but the Tephakin Army? But why?

[Quest_5175]
StartQuest1=The private army of Khali, heir of the Principality...
StartQuest2=What on earth are they planning here?
Mission1_1=The Dark Mission! Why are they here, at this Tephakin Army encampment?

[Quest_5177]
StartQuest1=What a fool! He was so focused on revenge, he couldn't see that the Nobility Alliance was using him!
StartQuest2=It was the Nobility Alliance who hired Woongpam to steal Pectra!
StartQuest3=Phew, better hurry. The Blood Mutants are attacking.
Mission1_1=Damn it, they were killed by those Blood Mutants.
Mission2_1=They killed an entire unit of scouts.

[Quest_5178]
StartQuest1=They're in denial. The remaining two places can't be safe either.
Mission1_1=Damn! They also got the observer unit. Is he the only survivor?

[Quest_5179]
StartQuest1=I'd better send carrier pigeons to the Tephakin Principality for help.
StartQuest2=I pray the signal corps is safe...
Mission1_1=Damn it, even the signal corps was wiped out. Cursed Nobility Alliance!
Mission3_1=They even killed the carrier pigeons... Now the Tephakin Principality is completely cut off from the rest of the world.

[Quest_5180]
StartQuest1=I didn't see this coming. Great, now I've wasted precious time running around Wallkreiger.
StartQuest2=They must be busy playing with Pectra by now.
Mission1_1=A path is secured. Better get to the supply camp as soon as possible.

[Quest_5181]
StartQuest1=It was the army of Marquis Heston, of the Nobility Alliance.
StartQuest2=He has the Pectra wand.
Mission1_1=He doesn't have the Pectra wand!
Mission1_2=Wh-what is this place?

[Quest_5182]
Mission1_1=The Nobility Alliance has handed the Crystal Cave over to Pandemonium. Why?
Mission1_2=Better ask Chaisong.

[Quest_5191]
StartQuest1=I'll have to go to the Mining Gorge where the Crystal Cave is.
StartQuest2=I only have three days left until the deadline the Kanturians gave me.
Mission1_1=I'd better hurry. I've got only three days left until the deadline Kanturians gave me.
Mission2_1=No time to waste, I have to get to the Devias encampment.
Mission2_2=Muren might know why the Nobility Alliance handed the Crystal Cave over to Pandemonium.

[Quest_5192]
StartQuest1=The Nobility Alliance is just assisting the Pandemonium Army.

[Quest_5193]
StartQuest1=I couldn't find any clues. It's time to talk to their intelligence officers.
Mission1_1=I've found something! It's a letter.

[Quest_5194]
StartQuest1=What're they trying to do with these captured test subjects?
Mission1_1=Are these abominations test subjects?
Mission2_1=The test subjects are being transported somewhere. Not if I can help it!

[Quest_5195]
Mission1_1=They were heading northeast, to the Mining Association I guess.

[Quest_5196]
StartQuest1=I need to stop them. I know, I'll get rid of their horses and carriages.
Mission2_1=Killing innocent horses... What have I done?

[Quest_5197]
StartQuest1=They've sent a request to the Nobility Alliance for backup.
CompleteQuest1=Now, what should I do with you?

[Quest_5198]
StartQuest1=Woongpam, the leader of the Datanses, has come to the Crystal Cave.

[Quest_5199]
StartQuest1=I'll know if I investigate their weapons.
Mission1_1=All these weapons were made in Pandemonium. They're in league with each other.

[Quest_5200]
StartQuest1=Well, good for you and whatever crazy schemes you've got going on.
StartQuest2=OK, I need to get more information from the undercover Dracans Knight at Datans camp.
Mission1_1=Where the hell is the undercover Dracans Knight?

[Quest_5201]
StartQuest1=Pandemonium's brigade commander is guarding the place himself.
StartQuest2=They're using the test subjects for something terrible.
Mission1_1=I took care of him. Now, where's the lab?

[Quest_5207]
Mission1_1=Woongpam... He injected Pectra into the Tarsk and mutated it!

[Quest_5210]
StartQuest1=I know—I'll use the Inter-Area Portal Stone, that'll get me to the Devias outpost in the Mining Gorge.
StartQuest2=The Sanctum of the Elders isn't far from there.

[Quest_5211]
StartQuest1=Thrashers! Better get rid of them before they become a nuisance.
Mission1_1=Better hurry. I've got only two days until the deadline the Kanturians gave me.

[Quest_5212]
StartQuest1=He wants to warn the Elders of the Pandemonium Army's scheme to inject its soldiers with Pectra.
StartQuest2=I must fight my way through the Chakuas and meet Chaisong.
Mission1_1=Cowards! How dare you hurt innocent civilians!

[Quest_5213]
StartQuest1=I'd better find the nomads before they get hurt.

[Quest_5214]
StartQuest1=The nomads aren't here.
StartQuest2=No, I can't allow the Chakuas' stronghold to stay standing.
Mission1_1=The nomads, where are they?

[Quest_5215]
StartQuest1=They've bribed the Chakuas, just to mess with Chaisong.
StartQuest2=Better rescue the abducted nomads first.

[Quest_5216]
StartQuest1=That damned Chakua tricked me! He lured me into a camp full of his own kind!
StartQuest2=Hahaha, you fools. I could slay you all without breaking a sweat.

[Quest_5217]
StartQuest1=Hm? Is that a lodge up on that hill?

[Quest_5218]
StartQuest1=They've been kept here. I'm glad they're all alive.
Mission1_1=Oh, their bodies must be numb after being tied up for so long.

[Quest_5219]
StartQuest1=Where the Silver Sparrowhawk Camp is? OK, let's go save them!

[Quest_5220]
StartQuest1=The Keru Legion emerged from the Evil Energy... I wasn't expecting that! Its members are more skilled than I thought.
StartQuest2=But who? ...The Silver Sparrowhawks! I can't believe they fooled me!

[Quest_5221]
StartQuest1=I've wasted too much time already. Time to get moving to Dracanem.
StartQuest2=I must get to Chaisong before the Pandemonium Army gets its Pectra boost.
Mission1_1=Good, I've neutralized the Kerus' defense line. Soon Dracanem will be in sight.
Mission1_2=They must be their commanders.

[Quest_5222]
StartQuest1=Hmm, I don't know if I can persuade the Elders...

[Quest_5231]
Mission1_1=Ugh, remains of Dracanses everywhere!

[Quest_5223]
StartQuest1=Those scoundrels, they've invaded Dracanem to stop the Coalition and the Alliance from working together.
Mission3_1=This should be enough to convince the Elders.

[Quest_5224]
StartQuest1=Finally the Coalition and the Alliance can work together.
StartQuest2=Better let Muren know.
Mission1_1=Is that the Devias encampment?
Mission1_2=Muren will jump for joy when he finds out the joint operation has been approved.

[Quest_5225]
StartQuest1=It'll take too long for the two armies to join each other.
StartQuest2=I've got to infiltrate the prison camp before the amplifier is completed.

[Quest_5226]
StartQuest1=More wardens have escaped.
Mission2_1=No... they're all dead. The enemy's 17th Special Forces Group did this!

[Quest_5227]
StartQuest1=Bah, I've wasted too much time already.
StartQuest2=If the prisoners are injected with Pectra, it'll be the end of Drapia.
StartQuest3=I must destroy the amplifier before that happens.

[Quest_5228]
StartQuest1=Damn! The leader of the prisoners is blocking the way to the amplifier.

[Quest_5233]
Mission1_1=That's what happens to those who covet Pectra.
Mission1_2=Finally I've got the Pectra wand back!

[Quest_5235]
StartQuest1=Are those Dracans Warriors?

[Quest_5236]
StartQuest1=I have to find a Pectra amplifier to mutate prisoners.

[Quest_5240]
StartQuest1=Damn it, they didn't steal just one wand—they stole two!
StartQuest2=The Prison Camp was just a decoy!
Mission1_1=Ah, this must be the War Shelter.

[Quest_5241]
StartQuest1=First, I need to assess the severity of the Pandemonic changes in this area.
Mission1_1=Oh no! The plants... everything on the land is changing rapidly.
Mission2_1=This is not good, things are changing too quickly. Just a matter of time before this spreads across the entire continent.
Mission3_1=Those thugs, what are they trying to do with the other wand?

[Quest_5242]
StartQuest1=Whoa, what's that giant monster? Even creatures are going through Pandemonic changes!
Mission1_1=Better go to the Union Headquarters.
Mission1_2=Both Chaisong and Muren should be there.

[Quest_5243]
StartQuest1=They've grown so big, they look like they're going to explode soon!

[Quest_5244]
StartQuest1=They're using the other wand to build Evil Energy tunnels.

[Quest_5245]
StartQuest1=If I follow the Pandemonic energy, it'll lead me to Evil Energy tunnels.
StartQuest2=Where can I find scorpion oil?
Mission1_1=This should be enough.

[Quest_5246]
StartQuest1=I'm machine illiterate...
Mission1_1=Yes! It's working!

[Quest_5247]
StartQuest1=An Evil Energy tunnel is being built in one of the two places.
StartQuest2=I'll rescue the Kanturian's daughter first.
Mission1_1=Bah, those goddamn Gremlins!

[Quest_5248]
StartQuest1=My condolences, Kanturian hermit. I'll avenge her death.

[Quest_5249]
StartQuest1=I got fooled again. I'll have to find their commander on my own.
Mission1_1=The woman you killed was the daughter of Wake, a Kanturian.
Mission1_2=Time to go. Muren and Chaisong must be waiting impatiently...

[Quest_5250]
StartQuest1=I've no choice. I can't let the Tears fall into the hands of those Pandemonium scoundrels.

[Quest_5251]
StartQuest1=An adopted Human daughter... This will require some... adjustment.
Mission1_1=Damn it! They beat me to it.

[Quest_5252]
Mission1_1=Be careful... Oh, that's a good boy!
Mission2_1=I avenged his mother's death, but the rage still lingers on.
Mission2_2=I grow tired of this war.

[Quest_5253]
StartQuest1=Soon the ward of Neria's Tears will perish.
StartQuest2=I have to get Neria's Tears before the Pandemonium Army.

[Quest_5255]
Mission1_1=What... The wounded...

[Quest_5256]
StartQuest1=I really need to meet up with the Union,
StartQuest2=but I just can't ignore these people.

[Quest_5257]
StartQuest1=OK, better hurry and catch up with the Union.
StartQuest2=The Evil Energy tunnel will be completed soon.

[Quest_5258]
StartQuest1=Oh, what's that gigantic thing?

[Quest_5259]
StartQuest1=It's a massive cannon, and it's aimed north, at the Union.
Mission1_1=I hope I destroyed that massive cannon in time, before it damaged the Union.

[Quest_5260]
Mission1_1=Those men over there. Are they the Dracans Knights?

[Quest_5261]
StartQuest1=So this is what Kelbra wanted Neria's Tears for, right from the beginning.
StartQuest2=I have to stop the Ice Dragon's resurrection, or it'll be the end of the Union.
Mission1_1=Wow, I've never seen so many dragons in one place. The power of Neria's Tears is unfathomable.
MissionDeco2_1_1=I stopped the Ice Dragon from resurrecting, but its spirit got through! It flew to the southwest.
MissionDeco2_1_2=Looks like I've got some loose ends to tie up.

[Quest_5270]
StartQuest1=If the Silverfel Knights join us, there's still hope!

[Quest_5262]
StartQuest1=Kundun... Have I misjudged him?
Mission1_1=I don't get it, why would Kundun want these skulls?

[Quest_5271]
StartQuest1=Bah, the Silverfel Knights aren't coming. I'll have to meet up with the Union by myself.
StartQuest2=I hope the damage isn't too severe...

[Quest_5263]
StartQuest1=We don't have enough soldiers left. We've lost so many...

[//Quest_5264]
Mission1_1=What's that? Strange Slaughterer? Seriously?

[Quest_5264]
Mission1_1=Let's get going. Four of us should be enough.

[Quest_5266]
StartQuest1=He's the commander of the Pandemonium Army in Litenberg.
StartQuest2=He must be guarding the Evil Energy tunnel.
CompleteQuest1=Now, all that's left is to destroy the Evil Energy tunnel.

[Quest_601]
StartQuest1=Even the members of city garrisons are being drafted.
StartQuest2=The situation must be critical.

[Quest_602]
StartQuest1=The Warriors must be the name of its regular army.
Mission1_1=They wouldn't dare attack Qwyinan again, at least for a while.

[Quest_603]
StartQuest1=The Medians...

[Quest_604]
StartQuest1=They're rather bold.

[Quest_605]
StartQuest1=Two opposing states on one continent...
StartQuest2=I'm amazed both still stand.

[Quest_606]
StartQuest1=This base won't last long.
Mission1_1=There are so many, I've lost count.
Mission2_1=The Mission has occupied the north.

[Quest_607]
StartQuest1=Dragons showed up when the fire in the brazier was extinguished...
StartQuest2=This doesn't add up. I thought dragons were conceived from Neria's Tears.

[Quest_608]
StartQuest1=Everywhere I go, there are people brainwashed by the Mission.
Mission1_1=They left nothing but their scales behind.
Mission1_2=They were fools, yes, but I do pity them.

[Quest_609]
StartQuest1=Why haven't they left yet?
Mission1_1=I didn't properly secure my retreat route, and that's on me.

[Quest_610]
StartQuest1=A Lorencian shepherd in Drapia…
StartQuest2=Sheesh! The stars must have been misaligned on the day he was born!

[Quest_611]
StartQuest1=Priest Mannu is a good man.
Mission1_1=They won't dare show up near the breeding camp again.

[Quest_612]
StartQuest1=Please don't die...

[Quest_613]
StartQuest1=It seems they only respond to force.
Mission1_1=Eliminated an advance party of Chakuas.
Mission2_1=Eliminated the second advance party of Chakuas.

[Quest_614]
StartQuest1=They're attacking from both the north and the south.
Mission1_1=These are pretty heavy.

[Quest_615]
StartQuest1=It's time to burn things down.
Mission1_1=The Chakuas will have to starve from now on.

[Quest_616]
StartQuest1=I feel like I've been set up.
Mission1_1=This doesn't look tempting.
Mission2_1=I've got enough meat from the small ones.

[Quest_617]
StartQuest1=I can't believe we've crossed paths again.

[Quest_618]
StartQuest1=I've got to stop them before more Evil Energy tunnels open.
Mission1_1=They're weak, for mutants.

[Quest_619]
StartQuest1=The Mission must be behind this.
Mission1_1=I knew the Mission was behind this, but why?

[Quest_620]
StartQuest1=I have to do this, for my loved ones.
Mission1_1=Does this strange substance really have medicinal benefits?

[Quest_621]
StartQuest1=They can smell money from miles away.
Mission1_1=What good does revenge do now?
Mission1_2=
Mission2_1=
Mission3_1=
Mission4_1=Rest in peace, child.
Mission4_2=

[Quest_8102]
Mission1_1=He's not here, either. Mukler, you'd better wish I can't find you.

[Quest_208]
MissionDeco1_1_1=Dumpain Kerka is the law and the truth.
MissionDeco2_1_1=Those who plot against Ohrdor will be exiled.

[Quest_209]
MissionDeco1_1_1=This is heavy. How important can it be?

[Quest_210]
MissionDeco1_1_1=My storage service is so popular, everyone on the continent wants it!
MissionDeco2_1_1=You came at the right time. I've got some potions I need to deliver to the Enova Continent.
MissionDeco3_1_1=It's time my great armor sees the world.

[Quest_211]
MissionDeco1_1_1=Where on earth is Kundun?
MissionDeco2_1_1=Is there any lucrative job I can take on?
MissionDeco3_1_1=Soon Ohrdor will be covered in darkness.

[Quest_222]
MissionDeco1_1_1=Hey, you didn't open this fruit box, did you?
MissionDeco1_2_1=What's in that box? It looks suspicious.

[Quest_325]
MissionDeco1_2_1=We must get rid of the Gnolls!
MissionDeco1_3_1=We're here, and it's all thanks to you, Knight!

[//Quest_424]
MissionDeco1_1_1=I really want to find the treasure.
MissionDeco1_2_1=Thank you for bringing me here safely.
MissionDeco2_1_1=Please cover me while I look for the treasure!
MissionDeco2_1_2=Please protect me from the monsters!

[Quest_528]
MissionDeco1_1_1=Knight, let's go!
MissionDeco1_2_1=I'm here, and it's all thanks to you, Knight!
MissionDeco1_2_2=Thank you! You deserve to be called Tephakin's Light.

[Quest_918]
MissionDeco2_1_1=Knight... Please... take me... ugh... to my... unit...
MissionDeco2_1_2=The Devias Knights should be... able to get them... out of... here... safe... Ugh...
MissionDeco2_2_1=Th-thank you... But I don't think... I... *Cough*
MissionDeco2_3_1=Darn it! I'm late. I'd better tell my brother.

[Quest_1213]
MissionDeco1_1_1=Watch for the freed captives!
MissionDeco1_2_1=Let's keep going!
MissionDeco2_1_1=I'm glad I have such a strong knight like you with me.
MissionDeco2_2_1=Thank you. My late comrades will also thank you from Heaven.

[Quest_1316]
MissionDeco1_1_1=Off we go to collect the Pandemonic Energy!
MissionDeco1_2_1=Thank you for keeping me safe. How'd you like to become my assistant?

[Quest_10724]
StartQuest1=They severed the routes in preparation for the Pandemonium invasion...
StartQuest2=I must reconnect the routes using Rugard Holy Stone.

[Quest_10735]
GreetingQuest1=(This energy is powerful, but I can't have it.)
GreetingQuest2=(Is it impossible to get the power I need to fight the Demon God?)

[Quest_1406]
Mission2_1=Is he already infected? I'm sorry, Jansen...
Mission2_2=Hm, what are those structures? They look suspicious.

[Quest_1000001]
MissionDeco1_2_1=They're coming!!
MissionDeco1_3_1=There's more. Another wave incoming!!
MissionDeco1_4_1=Phew, what a relief. All thanks to you.

[Quest_1000002]
MissionDeco1_2_1=The monsters are here!
MissionDeco1_2_2=We have to be careful of them when moving!
MissionDeco1_3_1=Phew, we arrived safely. We are saved!

[Quest_1000003]
MissionDeco1_2_1=The monsters are here!
MissionDeco1_2_2=We have to be careful of them when moving!
MissionDeco1_3_1=Phew, we arrived safely. All thanks to you.

[Quest_1000004]
MissionDeco1_1_1=There's no use hiding. Show yourself!!
MissionDeco1_3_1=Is there more?!
Mission1_1=We barely defeated them.

[Quest_1000005]
MissionDeco1_1_1=We just need to disarm the bomb, over there!
MissionDeco1_2_1=I failed...
MissionDeco1_3_1=It's disarmed...
MissionDeco1_4_1=What the...!!
Mission1_1=This should be enough.

[Quest_1000011]
StartQuest1=So this place, Dudrin, is a dominion of the Lorencia Kingdom.
Mission1_1=What the hell does the Lorencia Kingdom Army actually do?

[Quest_1000012]
StartQuest1=So this place, Dudrin, is a dominion of the Lorencia Kingdom.
Mission1_1=What the hell does the Lorencia Kingdom Army actually do?

[Quest_9599]
StartQuest1=Wait, is that... a Rift? Who the hell created it?
StartQuest2=Ah! I'm sure the Rift Research Society will know something about this.

[Quest_127]
MissionDeco1_1_1=There's nothing but impure iron here. I want newk.

[Quest_313]
MissionDeco2_1_1=There's nothing but dirt and sand here.

[Quest_5431]
StartQuest1=These stowaways probably won't talk unless they get a good beating.
Mission1_1=That should draw their attention. Even the chief won't be able to ignore that.

[Quest_5433]
Mission1_1=That smuggler really is wrecked.
Mission1_2=Maybe I can weave these plant stalks into something and fix it with it.
Mission3_1=Darn it. I can't. They aren't enough to repair the damage.
Mission3_2=Hm? Is that... an elf?

[Quest_5434]
StartQuest1=I'd better rescue the farmers first.
Mission2_1=...Are they all dead?
Mission2_2=Frog Beasts did this. Goblins must have let them loose.
Mission3_1=I hope the farm is safe. I'd better hurry.

[Quest_5435]
StartQuest1=Pillaging in the ravages of war? You bastards!
Mission2_1=Now that their commander is dead, the rest will scatter naturally.
Mission3_1=You shouldn't covet what others possess.

[Quest_5436]
StartQuest1=I must repair the stone launcher, and get to the national border.
Mission1_1=I'd better head out to the national border post now. I've been here too long.

[Quest_5437]
Mission2_1=Oh, no! How can the queen's guards butcher civilians?
Mission3_1=We're running out of time. I'm sorry, I can only give you a ride in this way.
Mission4_1=Even the Ashas Army failed. Those corpses, if left unburied, spread diseases.
Mission5_1=Those Dark Shadows... They can't be left alone.

[Quest_5438]
Mission2_1=This is for hurting the civilians.
Mission3_1=Is this the fortress of the Ashases?

[Quest_5439]
StartQuest1=Was the interruption during the Ashas Priests' telepathic communications the cause of the butchery?
StartQuest2=I'd better get to the Communion Shrine.

[Quest_5440]
StartQuest1=The Ashas archpriest is meeting with the elven knight commander. I hope there will be good news.
StartQuest2=Sigh, by the way, I still haven't found out where that girl is.

[Quest_5442]
StartQuest1=Slave merchants. The Dark Shadows are a despicable lot.
Mission1_1=Dantarexes? I'd better take care of these first.
Mission2_1=Where are the abducted villagers?

[Quest_5443]
StartQuest1=I'll see you can never trade people again.
Mission1_1=I think I've got enough fire arrows. Now, where's the ship?
Mission2_1=It's burning well. Alright, I'd better return to the Holy Bunker now.
Mission2_2=I wonder if those two have found that blue-skinned girl.

[Quest_5444]
StartQuest1=She waged war just to steal that blue gemstone. You mean, that little girl did?
StartQuest2=What is that gemstone, and who's this girl?
StartQuest3=I'd better go to the Ancient Castle of the Pioneers. I'll know everything if I catch that girl.

[Quest_5447]
Mission2_1=The Dark Shadows are making them pay for destroying their Sapientia Temple.

[Quest_5449]
Mission2_1=This is the Dark Mission's black magic. But... how?
